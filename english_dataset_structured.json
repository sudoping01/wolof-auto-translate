        "Perhaps I should have asked for your help but how long could that last?",
        "I have been saddled with debts for fifteen years.",
        "My hopes of clearing them by selling some furniture came to nothing",
        "I wanted to be a writer, now my manuscripts are worm eaten.",
        "I hoped to educate my boy, but it was not to be.",
        "And the girl... she is at rest.",
        "Sometimes it is necessary to leave the ancestral home.",
        "In town I may earn a little reciting from the scriptures",
        "Hi.",
        "I've got an appointment with Mr. Ullman.",
        "My name is Jack Torrance.",
        "His office is the first door on the left.",
        "Thank you.",
        "-Mr.",
        "Ullman?",
        "-Yes.",
        "-I'm Jack Torrance.",
        "-Oh, come on in, Jack.",
        "-Very nice to meet you.",
        "-Nice to meet you.",
        "-This is my secretary, Susie.",
        "-Hello.",
        "-Susie, how do you do?",
        "-Any trouble finding us?",
        "No problem at all.",
        "I made the trip in 3 1/2 hours.",
        "That's very good time.",
        "Sit down a minute, Jack.",
        "Just make yourself at home.",
        "Like some coffee?",
        "If you're having some, I wouldn't mind.",
        "Thanks.",
        "-Susie.",
        "-Sure.",
        "And ask Bill Watson to join us.",
        "Yes, I will.",
        "Mom?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?",
        "Sure I do.",
        "It'll be lots of fun.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I guess so.",
        "Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.",
        "I know.",
        "It always takes a little time to make new friends.",
        "Yeah, I guess so.",
        "What about Tony?",
        "He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.",
        "[IN TONY'S VOICE] No, I ain't, Mrs. Torrance.",
        "Now, come on, Tony.",
        "Don't be silly.",
        "I don't want to go there.",
        "How come you don't want to go?",
        "I just don't.",
        "Let's just wait and see.",
        "We're all going to have a real good time.",
        "Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.",
        "How do you do, Bill?",
        "-Nice to meet you.",
        "-Pleasure to meet you.",
        "Grab a chair, Bill.",
        "Join in.",
        "Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.",
        "I'd like you to take him around soon as we're through.",
        "Fine.",
        "Jack is a schoolteacher.",
        "Uh, formerly a schoolteacher.",
        "BILL:",
        "What line of work are you in now?",
        "I'm a writer.",
        "Teaching's been more or less a way of making ends meet.",
        "This ought to be quite a change for you.",
        "Well, I'm looking for a change.",
        "Our people in Denver recommended Jack very highly, and for once I agree with them.",
        "Let's see, where were we?",
        "I was about to explain that our season here runs from May 15th to October 30th.",
        "Then we close down completely until the following May.",
        "Do you mind if I ask why you do that?",
        "It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.",
        "It would be.",
        "The problem is the enormous cost it would be to keep the road to Sidewinder open.",
        "It's a 25-mile stretch of road.",
        "It gets 20 feet of snow during the winter.",
        "There's just no way to make it economically feasible to keep it clear.",
        "When the place was built in 1907 there was very little interest in winter sports.",
        "This site was chosen for its seclusion and scenic beauty.",
        "It's certainly got plenty of that.",
        "That's right.",
        "Did they give you any idea in Denver about what the job entails?",
        "Only in a very general way.",
        "Well the winters can be fantastically cruel.",
        "The basic idea is to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.",
        "This consists mainly of running the boiler heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs so the elements can't get a foothold.",
        "That sounds fine to me.",
        "Physically, it's not a very demanding job.",
        "The only thing that can get a bit trying here during the winter is a tremendous sense of isolation.",
        "That just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.",
        "I'm outlining a new writing project.",
        "Five months of peace is just what I want.",
        "That's very good, Jack.",
        "Because, for some people solitude and isolation can, of itself, become a problem.",
        "Not for me.",
        "How about your wife and son?",
        "Do you think they'll take to it?",
        "They'll love it.",
        "Great.",
        "Well, before I turn you over to Bill there's one other thing I think we should talk about.",
        "Not to sound melodramatic but it's been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.",
        "I'm intrigued.",
        "I don't suppose they said anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970.",
        "I don't believe they did.",
        "ULLMAN:",
        "Well....",
        "My predecessor in this job hired a man named Charles Grady as the winter caretaker.",
        "He came up with his wife and two little girls of about 8 and 10.",
        "He had a good employment record, good references.",
        "And from what I've been told, he seemed like a completely normal individual.",
        "But at some point during the winter he must have suffered some kind of a complete mental breakdown.",
        "He ran amuck and killed his family with an ax.",
        "Stacked them neatly in a room in the west wing, and then he put both barrels of his shotgun in his mouth.",
        "The police thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin fever.",
        "A kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are shut in together over long periods of time.",
        "Wow.",
        "That is quite a story.",
        "Yeah, it is.",
        "It's still hard for me to believe it actually happened here.",
        "But it did.",
        "And, uh I think you can appreciate why I wanted to tell you about it.",
        "I certainly can.",
        "I also understand why your people in Denver left it for you to tell me.",
        "Obviously, some people can be put off from staying in a place where something like that happened.",
        "You can rest assured that's not going to happen with me.",
        "And as far as my wife is concerned I'm sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her.",
        "She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict.",
        "Tony, do you think Dad'll get the job?",
        "He already did.",
        "He's going to phone Wendy up in a few minutes to tell her.",
        "Hello.",
        "-Hi, babe.",
        "-Hi, hon.",
        "How's it going?",
        "Great.",
        "I'm at the hotel and I still have a lot to go through.",
        "I don't think I can get home before 9:00 or 10:00.",
        "Sounds like you got the job.",
        "Right.",
        "It's a beautiful place.",
        "You and Danny are going to love it.",
        "Tony, why don't you want to go to the hotel?",
        "I don't know.",
        "You do too know.",
        "Now come on, tell me.",
        "I don't want to.",
        "Please.",
        "No.",
        "Now, Tony, tell me.",
        "DOCTOR:",
        "Now, hold your eyes still so I can see.",
        "That's good.",
        "Now the other one.",
        "Good boy.",
        "Now, Danny when you were brushing your teeth do you remember if you smelled anything funny or saw any bright, flashing lights or anything at all strange?",
        "No.",
        "DOCTOR:",
        "Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?",
        "Yes.",
        "What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?",
        "My mom was saying, \"Wake up.",
        "Wake up, Danny, wake up.\"",
        "Now, Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?",
        "Talking to Tony.",
        "Is Tony one of your animals?",
        "No. He's a little boy that lives in my mouth.",
        "Tony's his imaginary friend.",
        "DOCTOR:",
        "Oh.",
        "If you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?",
        "No.",
        "Why not?",
        "Because he hides.",
        "Where does he go?",
        "To my stomach.",
        "Does Tony ever tell you to do things?",
        "I don't want to talk about Tony anymore.",
        "Okay.",
        "That's fine.",
        "All right, Danny.",
        "I'm going to ask you to do me a favor and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.",
        "Do I have to?",
        "Yes.",
        "I'd like you to.",
        "We're going in the other room for a few minutes and talk.",
        "I'll come back and check on you.",
        "-Okay.",
        "-Bye.",
        "-Shall we go into the living room?",
        "-Yes.",
        "-Please.",
        "-Thank you.",
        "Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.",
        "I'm quite sure there's nothing physically wrong with Danny.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Oh.",
        "He seems absolutely fine now.",
        "But you should've seen him.",
        "I know.",
        "Kids can scare you to death.",
        "But believe me, these episodes are not at all uncommon.",
        "And they look much worse than they are.",
        "But what was the matter with him?",
        "Most of the time, these episodes with kids are never explained.",
        "They're brought on by emotional factors and rarely occur again.",
        "They're more akin to autohypnosis a kind of self-induced trance.",
        "If it reoccurs, which I doubt we can always think about having some tests done.",
        "No, thank you.",
        "I'm sure you're right.",
        "Have you been in Boulder long?",
        "Only about three months.",
        "We're from Vermont.",
        "My husband was teaching school there.",
        "Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend....",
        "Tony.",
        "Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?",
        "No, um....",
        "Let's see....",
        "I guess Danny started talking to Tony about the time we put him in nursery school.",
        "Did he adjust well to school?",
        "No.",
        "He didn't like it too much at first.",
        "Then he had an injury, so we kept him out for a while and....",
        "Yeah, I guess that's about when I first noticed he was talking to Tony.",
        "What sort of injury did he have?",
        "He dislocated his shoulder.",
        "How did he manage to do that?",
        "It was just one of those things, you know.",
        "Purely an accident.",
        "My husband had been drinking and he came home about three hours late.",
        "So he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.",
        "And Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room and my husband grabbed his arm to pull him away from them.",
        "It's just the sort of thing you do 100 times with a child you know, in a park or in the street.",
        "But on this particular occasion my husband just used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.",
        "Anyway, something good did come out of it all because he said:",
        "\"Wendy, I'm never going to touch another drop.",
        "And if I do, you can leave me.\"",
        "And he didn't.",
        "He hasn't had any alcohol in 5 months.",
        "Boy.",
        "We must really be high up.",
        "The air feels so different.",
        "Mm-hm.",
        "Dad?",
        "Yes?",
        "I'm hungry.",
        "You should've eaten your breakfast.",
        "We'll get you something as soon as we get to the hotel.",
        "Okay, Mom.",
        "Wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?",
        "I think that was farther west, in the Sierras.",
        "Oh.",
        "What was the Donner party?",
        "They were a party of settlers in covered wagon times.",
        "They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.",
        "They had to resort to cannibalism in order to stay alive.",
        "You mean they ate each other up?",
        "They had to in order to survive.",
        "Jack.",
        "Don't worry, Mom.",
        "I know all about cannibalism.",
        "I saw it on TV.",
        "See, it's okay.",
        "He saw it on the television.",
        "-What time does the plane leave?",
        "-8:30.",
        "That gives us plenty of time to go over everything.",
        "-Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.",
        "-Bye.",
        "Good morning.",
        "I hope you haven't been waiting too long.",
        "No problem.",
        "We had time to grab a bite to eat.",
        "Good.",
        "Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.",
        "-Hi.",
        "-Is your family having a look around?",
        "No, my son's discovered the games room.",
        "-Has your luggage been brought in?",
        "-Right there.",
        "Oh, fine.",
        "In view of all we have to cover today I suggest we have a quick look at your apartment and get started.",
        "Have the Torrances' things brought to their apartment.",
        "-Fine.",
        "-I'd better collect my family first.",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "This is our Colorado Lounge.",
        "It's beautiful.",
        "My God!",
        "This place is fantastic, Isn it, hon?",
        "It sure is.",
        "I've never seen anything like this before.",
        "Are all these Indian designs authentic?",
        "I believe they're based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.",
        "They're really gorgeous.",
        "As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.",
        "This old place has had an illustrious past.",
        "In its heyday, it was a stopping place for the jet setters even before anybody knew what a jet set was.",
        "We had four presidents who stayed here.",
        "Lots of movie stars.",
        "Royalty?",
        "All the best people.",
        "This is the staff wing of the hotel.",
        "None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.",
        "-Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.",
        "-Goodbye, girls.",
        "ULLMAN:",
        "And here are your quarters.",
        "Living room, bedroom, bathroom.",
        "And a small bedroom for your son.",
        "Perfect for a child.",
        "-Yeah.",
        "-Yes.",
        "ULLMAN:",
        "Well, then.",
        "Place is very nicely self-contained.",
        "Easy to keep.",
        "Cozy.",
        "ULLMAN:",
        "Yes, very cozy for a family.",
        "If you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.",
        "Well, it's very homey.",
        "Yeah.",
        "This is our famous hedge maze.",
        "It's quite an attraction here.",
        "The walls are 13 feet high and the hedge is as old as the hotel itself.",
        "A lot of fun, but I wouldn't want to go in there unless I had an hour to spare to find my way out.",
        "WENDY:",
        "When was the Overlook built?",
        "Construction started in 1907.",
        "It was finished in 1909.",
        "The site's supposed to be on an Indian burial ground.",
        "They actually had to repel a few Indian attacks as they were building it.",
        "That's our Snowcat.",
        "Can you both drive a car?",
        "BOTH:",
        "Yes.",
        "ULLMAN:",
        "That's fine.",
        "Basically the Snowcat operates very much like a car.",
        "It won't take you long to get the hang of it.",
        "As a matter of fact, we brought a decorator in from Chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.",
        "Oh.",
        "He sure did a beautiful job.",
        "Pink and gold are my favorite colors.",
        "Well, this is our Gold Ballroom.",
        "Oh, I'll say!",
        "We can accommodate up to 300 people here very comfortably.",
        "Boy, we could really have a good party in this room.",
        "I'm afraid you won't do too well here unless you brought supplies.",
        "We remove the booze from the premises when we shut down.",
        "That reduces the insurance we normally have to carry.",
        "We don't drink.",
        "Then you're in luck.",
        "Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.",
        "This is Dick Hallorann, our head chef.",
        "Mr. Hallorann, I'm Jack.",
        "This is my wife, Winifred.",
        "Glad to meet you.",
        "The Torrances will take care of the Overlook this winter.",
        "That's just great.",
        "How do you folks like our hotel so far?",
        "It's just wonderful.",
        "Hi, Danny!",
        "I found him outside looking for you.",
        "Dan, did you get tired of bombing the universe?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Come on over here.",
        "-Thanks.",
        "-Thank you, Susie.",
        "I think it'd be good if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen while I continue on with Jack.",
        "It would be a pleasure.",
        "Right this way.",
        "Great.",
        "See you later, hon.",
        "Bye, darling.",
        "Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred.",
        "Now, are you a \"Winnie,\" or a \"Freddie\"?",
        "I'm a Wendy.",
        "Oh, Wendy.",
        "That's nice.",
        "That's the prettiest.",
        "This is the kitchen, huh?",
        "This is it.",
        "How do you like it, Danny?",
        "Is it big enough for you?",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's the biggest place I ever seen.",
        "This whole place is such an enormous maze.",
        "I'll have to leave a trail of breadcrumbs every time I come in.",
        "Don't let it get you down.",
        "It's big, but it ain't nothing but a kitchen.",
        "A lot of this stuff you'll never have to touch.",
        "I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.",
        "One thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food.",
        "You folks could eat here for a year and never have the same menu twice.",
        "Right here is our walk-in freezer.",
        "This is where we keep all of our meat.",
        "You got 15 rib roasts 30 ten-pound bags of hamburger.",
        "We got 12 turkeys, about 40 chickens 50 sirloin steaks, two dozen of pork roast and 20 legs of lamb.",
        "Do you like lamb, Doc?",
        "-No.",
        "-You don't?",
        "What's your favorite food, then?",
        "French fries and ketchup.",
        "I think we can manage that too, Doc.",
        "Come along, now.",
        "Watch your step.",
        "Mr. Hallorann how'd you know we call him Doc?",
        "-Beg your pardon?",
        "-Doc. You called Danny \"Doc\" twice.",
        "-I did?",
        "-Yeah.",
        "We call him Doc sometimes, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.",
        "But how did you know?",
        "I guess I probably heard you call him that.",
        "It's possible.",
        "But I honestly don't remember calling him that since we've been with you.",
        "Anyway, he looks like a Doc, doesn't he?",
        "[IMITATES BUGS BUNNY] Eh, what's up, Doc?",
        "Now, this is the storeroom.",

        "We'll never get through these woods!",
        "The current's too strong.",
        "And if we don't get this man back soon, it'll be too late.",
        "Are you showing us the way, or getting us lost?",
        "Sir!",
        "These things aren't helping us get home.",
        "There's more and more of them!",
        "This is your mother?",
        "A fine tree!",
        "That girl and the wolves...",
        "so this is where they live...",
        "We're getting in deeper, sir.",
        "This way leads into the other world.",
        "Yes, let's take a rest.",
        "Tracks...",
        "Three toes...and still fresh.",
        "Sir!",
        "What's wrong?",
        "Are you all right, sir?",
        "You're awfully pale...",
        "I told you!",
        "Did you see something?",
        "Forget it.",
        "Hang on a little longer.",
        "I'm sorry.",
        "It's gone...",
        "Why does he suddenly feel so light?",
        "Hey!",
        "It doesn't hurt!",
        "I'm cured!",
        "...ow!",
        "No, it's broken.",
        "Sir!",
        "You're exactly right!",
        "We're back at the ironworks!",
        "It's a fort!",
        "Lady Eboshi's ironworks.",
        "They melt iron sand into iron.",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey!",
        "- Someone's coming from the woods!",
        "- The wolf princess?",
        "It's me!",
        "Koroku the ox-driver!",
        "It's true!",
        "He's crossing the lake!",
        "What's all this noise?",
        "! Be quiet when I'm writing!",
        "Koruku's come back from the dead!",
        "What? !",
        "You're not a ghost.",
        "It's never the guards that die.",
        "Move!",
        "Who's the man in the hood, sir?",
        "An outsider...",
        "Listen, Riflemen...this gentleman carried your man all the way here.",
        "Thank him.",
        "Ow! Don't grab me there!",
        "Hey, you! Wait!",
        "First, my thanks for bringing back our men.",
        "But something bothers me...",
        "You got here in less than half the time we did through the Deer God's forest, carrying two...",
        "Koroku! You're alive!",
        "Toki!",
        "Look at that leg!",
        "How are you going to drive oxen now? !",
        "But...but...",
        "Scaring me half to death! The wolf-god should've eaten you!",
        "Then I could find a better husband!",
        "Toki! They're all listening! Toki, save your love-talk for later.",
        "Leaving them there to die!",
        "Some escort you are!",
        "You don't do any real work here.",
        "At least act when there's danger!",
        "What could I do?",
        "Thank you.",
        "My husband's an idiot, but I'm glad he's safe.",
        "Good.",
        "I was afraid maybe I'd done something wrong.",
        "You look very handsome.",
        "Show us your face.",
        "Gonza...",
        "I would like to thank the traveler.",
        "Bring him to me later.",
        "Koroku...",
        "It's good you're back.",
        "I apologize.",
        "Don't say that, Milady.",
        "He'll just take advantage of you.",
        "Forgive me, Toki.",
        "I shouldn't have let it happen.",
        "If you hadn't been there, Milady the wolves would've got them all.",
        "Go and rest, Traveler.",
        "Hey!",
        "You are handsome!",
        "We had to fight off Moro to bring this rice, you know.",
        "Dish it out!",
        "Where?",
        "Him?",
        "Toki was right!",
        "- He is handsome!",
        "- A bit young...",
        "That never stopped you before!",
        "Quiet out there!",
        "We lost two men!",
        "There's lots of handsome men here!",
        "Bunch of cowherds!",
        "Come over to our place, Traveler!",
        "Forget this stinking barn!",
        "Watch your mouth!",
        "We risked our lives to bring the rice you're eating.",
        "And who made the iron that bought that rice?",
        "We work those bellows all night long!",
        "I would like to see where you work, if you don't mind...",
        "Really?",
        "We'll have to work in make-up!",
        "Rouge, too?",
        "Don't forget!",
        "We'll be waiting!",
        "Don't mind them, sir.",
        "Lady Eboshi spoils them.",
        "A good town has happy women.",
        "But women working the bellows in an ironworks?",
        "Their presence defiles the iron.",
        "Milady buys up the contract of every brothel girl she finds!",
        "She's kind, that's all.",
        "There's rice on your face, old man.",
        "But she's not afraid of ancient laws, or of curses.",
        "Or of gods, either.",
        "You should've seen her with Nago!",
        "'Nago'?",
        "A huge boar-god.",
        "He ruled the forest around here.",
        "We couldn't get near the mountains.",
        "All we could do was sit here and look up at them.",
        "The sand down below was worked out.",
        "Lots of people had their eye on this place.",
        "The boars got them all.",
        "To get sand, we have to clear the trees.",
        "Nago got mad.",
        "There they go again!",
        "Then Lady Eboshi came along with her guns.",
        "Sir?",
        "What's wrong?",
        "Does your arm hurt?",
        "I was just thinking about that boar...",
        "He must have died full of hate.",
        "Sorry to keep you waiting...",
        "That's good iron.",
        "We were late with tomorrow's shipment.",
        "Let's have a rest.",
        "Tell the others.",
        "Some think you're spying for the samurai, or the wolf princess.",
        "Many have their eyes on our iron.",
        "May I ask why you're here?",
        "I'm sure you know this.",
        "It shattered the bones of a giant boar, rotted his flesh and made him a monster.",
        "When I tried to stop him, I was left with this scar: a curse unto death.",
        "Where is your land?",
        "I've never seen an elk like yours.",
        "Between north and east.",
        "That's all I will say.",
        "Answer when you're asked or I'll cut you in two!",
        "What do you plan to do?",
        "See with eyes unclouded.",
        "'Eyes unclouded'?",
        "I see.",
        "Take over, Gonza.",
        "My garden, where none dare come.",
        "Come, if you wish to know my secret.",
        "Good evening.",
        "We've just finished.",
        "It's still heavy.",
        "You hold it so lightly...",
        "Too light and it'll fall apart.",
        "They aren't for me.",
        "They're for the other women here.",
        "Won't that be a sight!",
        "This is the new gun these people have contrived.",
        "The Chinese ones are too heavy.",
        "It will kill monsters and pierce samurai armor.",
        "Beware!",
        "Lady Eboshi wants to rule the world!",
        "I'm sorry to rush you. I'll send sak\u00e9 later.",
        "Won't that be nice!",
        "You stole the boar's woods and made a monster of him.",
        "Now will you breed new hatreds with those guns?",
        "I regret that you suffer. I fired that shot. It is me that brainless pig should have cursed.",
        "Would your right hand like to kill me?",
        "To lift the curse, my left would, too.",
        "But I fear it would not stop there.",
        "Must it kill us all to be at peace?",
        "Milady...",
        "Osa speaks.",
        "Milady...do not scorn the young man's strength.",
        "Young man, I too am cursed.",
        "I know well your rage and your grief.",
        "I know this, but I beg you not to kill this lady.",
        "She is the only one who looked upon us as human.",
        "Without fear of our disease she washed our rotting flesh, bandaged us...",
        "Osa...",
        "Life is suffering. It is hard.",
        "The world is cursed, people are cursed, but still we wish to live...",
        "Forgive my foolish raving... They're back. At night they come to plant trees and take back the mountain.",
        "Ashitaka, will you stay here and work with me?",
        "Do you want even the Deer God's woods?",
        "Without the ancient gods, the wild ones are mere beasts.",
        "With the forest gone and the wolves with it, this will be a land of riches.",
        "That girl will be human.",
        "Who?",
        "Mononoke, the wild girl whose soul the wolves stole.",
        "She lives to kill me.",
        "It is said the blood of the Deer God will cure disease.",
        "It could cure these people, and perhaps even lift your curse.",
        "Milady...what do you think?",
        "Very well made.",
        "Perfect for ruling the world.",
        "But it's still a bit heavy.",
        "Oh, dear!",
        "Look who's here!",
        "Let me work the bellows.",
        "Huh?",
        "Hey, wait!",
        "May I try?",
        "If he insists...",
        "You really came!",
        "What did I tell you?",
        "Look, she's fixing her kimono!",
        "You'll never keep that pace.",
        "It's hard work.",
        "Yep.",
        "We work four days' straight.",
        "Is life hard here?",
        "Yeah, but it's better than life in the towns.",
        "We eat our fill, and the men know their place.",
        "I see...",
        "- You go tomorrow?",
        "- Stay longer!",
        "Work here!",
        "Thank you, but there is someone I must meet.",
        "She's here!",
        "The wolf princess!",
        "It's her!",
        "Stop!",
        "I don't want to fight you!",
        "She's after Milady!",
        "Build up the fires!",
        "Riflemen to the stockade!",
        "Keep her inside!",
        "Stay at your posts!",
        "She's up on the roof!",
        "Don't get excited!",
        "Keep working!",
        "The fire mustn't go out!",
        "- Is she alone?",
        "- Yes.",
        "We have her cornered.",
        "It's Milady she came for.",
        "Can you hear me, Princess Mononoke?",
        "I'm here.",
        "If you would avenge your tribe here are some who seek vengeance for husbands killed by wolves.",
        "Come out!",
        "We have a score to settle!",
        "There she is!",
        "Out of the way!",
        "You'll get hit!",
        "It's a trap!",
        "Stop!",
        "Wolf-God Princess!",
        "Go back to the woods!",
        "Don't die for nothing!",
        "I knew it!",
        "Let him do as he likes.",
        "Got her!",
        "She's falling!",
        "Stay back!",
        "Even cut off, the head can still bite.",
        "Aim where she falls.",
        "Fire!",
        "Stay back!",
        "Wake up!",
        "No!",
        "Get her!",
        "Don't let her go!",
        "Kill her! Are you all right, sir? Out of my way!",
        "Villain!",
        "You're one of them, too!",
        "Halt!",
        "Step aside.",
        "What are you doing? !",
        "The girl is mine.",
        "I'm sure she'll make a lovely wife.",
        "There is a demon inside you.",
        "And in her.",
        "Look on this!",
        "It is the form of the hate within me!",
        "It rots my flesh, and summons my death!",
        "Do not make the hate grow!",
        "Enough talk of your curse!",
        "I'll cut that arm off!",
        "Milady!",
        "Someone take her!",
        "Don't worry. She'll be all right.",
        "I will take the girl!",
        "Wait! You don't treat Lady Eboshi like that!",
        "Don't move!",
        "Kiyo, no!",
        "He still walks...",
        "- How's Milady?",
        "- Safe, sir.",
        "Bring me my gun! Riflemen, assemble here!",
        "They won't get away!",
        "Toki, quick! You're... You can't pass, sir.",
        "The gate can't be opened without leave.",
        "Turn back, please...",
        "You helped one of us.",
        "We don't want to harm you.",
        "I came on my own two feet.",
        "I will leave on them.",
        "It takes ten men to open that gate!",
        "Sir, no! You'll die!",
        "He moved it!",
        "Move aside!",
        "Wolves!",
        "Flint!",
        "Stop! Your princess is safe!",
        "I'm coming!",
        "Yakul, let's go!",
        "I thank you.",
        "He's gone...",
        "Wait!",
        "He's mine!",
        "Did they shoot you?",
        "Are you dead?",
        "Why did you stop me? Speak while you still live!",
        "I didn't want you to die.",
        "I'm not afraid to die if it will drive the humans away!",
        "I knew that when I first saw you. You've wasted your life by getting in my way! I'll cut your throat!",
        "That'll shut you up!",
        "Live...",
        "I don't listen to humans!",
        "You're beautiful...",
        "What's wrong, San?",
        "Shall I crunch him for you?",
        "The apes...",
        "Apes!",
        "Do you mean disrespect to the tribe of Moro?",
        "This is our forest.",
        "Give us man.",
        "Give us man and go.",
        "Leave, before my fangs find you.",
        "Go.",
        "We eat man.",
        "We eat him.",
        "Let us eat man.",
        "Why would the tribe of the apes want to eat a man?",
        "We eat man.",
        "We have his strength.",
        "We want strength to drive humans away.",
        "You won't get that power by eating a man.",
        "All that will do is turn you into something else!",
        "We plant trees.",
        "Humans destroy them.",
        "Forest does not come back.",
        "We kill humans.",
        "The Deer God is with us.",
        "Don't give up.",
        "Plant your trees.",
        "We will fight for you to the last!",
        "Deer God will not fight.",
        "We die.",
        "Wolf girl not care.",
        "Wolf girl human.",
        "You monkey!",
        "I'll break your neck!",
        "Stop it!",
        "It's all right.",
        "You go ahead.",
        "I'll take care of the human.",
        "What about him?",
        "Can we eat him?",
        "No. Go on.",
        "Come here.",
        "Let's be friends.",
        "Help me carry your master.",
        "You're smart.",
        "You know not to set foot on this island.",
        "Humans stink!",
        "Go where you will.",
        "You're free.",
        "There he is!",
        "The night-walker!",
        "At last!",
        "Quick!",
        "Come and look!",
        "There's why we've been sitting in these stinking bearskins!",
        "Don't look!",
        "You'll go blind!",
        "This from the West Land's best hunter?",
        "This is a charter from the Mikado allowing us to subdue the Deer God!",
        "At night he becomes the night-walker.",
        "As night becomes day he changes form.",
        "He's vanishing...over there!",
        "Jiko!",
        "I know.",
        "Over there.",
        "There's hundreds of them.",
        "They're not from these woods.",
        "They're lords of some other mountain.",
        "It's Okkoto!",
        "From the South Island?",
        "There's no mistaking those tusks.",
        "Looks like he brought his whole tribe!",
        "He's seen us!",
        "Fall back!",
        "Come on! Jump!",
        "There's no wound!",
        "Yakul...",
        "If you're awake thank Yakul.",
        "He watched you the whole time.",
        "How do you know his name?",
        "He's told me all about you, your village, your forest...",
        "The Deer God brought you back to life, so I'll help you.",
        "I had this dream...a golden deer...",
        "Eat.",
        "Chew.",
        "We're here to kill the humans and save the forest.",
        "Why are there humans here?",
        "The girl is San, my daughter.",
        "The humans are everywhere. Go back to your mountain and kill them there.",
        "We kill for the forest of the Deer God.",
        "Why is there a man here?",
        "The Deer God healed his wound.",
        "We must give him back.",
        "The Deer God saved him? The Deer God healed his wound? !",
        "Why did he not save Nago?",
        "Is he not guardian of the forest? !",
        "The Deer God gives life, and takes it away.",
        "Have you boars forgotten even that?",
        "No! You begged the Deer God for him.",
        "You did not beg for Nago!",
        "He feared death... I, like him carry within me a poisoned human stone.",
        "Nago fled.",
        "I remain, and contemplate my death.",
        "Go to the Deer God!",
        "I have lived long enough, San.",
        "The Deer God will take my life.",
        "No, Mother!",
        "You've protected the Deer God!",
        "We are not fooled!",
        "Nago was beautiful and strong.",
        "Our brother would not run!",
        "You wolves ate him!",
        "Silence! You slander my mother!",
        "Hear me, O wild mountain gods...",
        "It was I who killed Nago.",
        "He had become a demon, and attacked our village.",
        "A huge boar. Here is my proof.",
        "I came to this land to ask the Deer God to lift this curse.",
        "He healed my wound, but the scar remains.",
        "I must suffer until the curse destroys me.",
        "Okkoto!",
        "Okkoto, wait!",
        "You mustn't eat him!",
        "Stand back.",
        "I will not eat him.",
        "Wolf-God Princess...",
        "Do not fear.",
        "I tell of Nago's end.",
        "My thanks to you, young one.",
        "It grieves us that a demon has come from our tribe.",

        "Uh, I don't know.",
        "Actually, we're lost.",
        "You know, a lot of people say...",
        "who have been through similar traumatic experiences... that the following moments kind of feel like you're moving kind of in slow motion.",
        "- Do you feel like that?",
        "- No.",

        "I call it.",
        "Uh, squirrel.",
        "- Well, you said you were hungry, Carly.",
        "- I don't think it's a squirrel.",
        "- It's a mink.",
        "- Really?",
        "How do you know?",
        "- Probably ran over it.",
        "In medical school, they make you work on animal cadavers before you get to the real thing.",
        "- It's a mink.",
        "- Oh.",
        "It's a mink?",
        "I need to be in Raleigh by 7:00.",
        "Hmm. Better get a move-on, then.",
        "You know, we should've just taken her to New York.",

        "Now get them trousers off, boy.",
        "Don't be a sissy.",
        "- All right.",
        "You know, I've been thinking about this whole wedding thing... and I think we should take a trip down to Mexico.",
        "- I'm talking about a long weekend... margaritas, the two of us on a beach alone, sunset.",
        "And, you know, I'm talking about just, just eloping.",

        "Um, no.",
        "No. Sorry.",
        "Damn it.",
        "Scott and Carly took all our friggin' sunscreen.",
        "Does he have any good CD's?",
        "Mmm.",
        "Definitely not.",
        "You know, I think this guy must be some kind of doctor.",
        "Maybe we could get him to write us some prescriptions when he gets back.",
        "He doesn't have any smokes either.",

        "- Why didn't you just fly?",
        "- I put all of my money into that car back there.",
        "Okay, forget eloping, but there is an idea we should discuss about the band for our wedding.",
        "I think we should hire a... you know, a Frank Sinatra-type, uh, lead singer... as opposed to a James Brown-type lead singer... because, you know, really, let's be honest, there's only oneJames Brown... and, you know, a faux James Brown is really quite intolerable.",
        "Evan?",
        "Where are you?",
        "You pissing or something?",
        "Evan?",
        "You know, plus he'd be grinding his hips, and my grandmother would be... yes, revolted but also strangely fascinated in a completely disturbing way... and, um...",
        "Baby?",
        "Carly, I wa...",
        "I was kidding.",

        "Look who's scared now.",
        "- Sorry.",
        "- Whatever.",
        "Just get me to a motel room... run me a very hot bath... and be prepared to provide me with a lot of orgasms.",
        "- Oh!",

        "If I don't condemn this man I know Caiphas will start a rebellion.",
        "If I do condemn him, then his followers may.",
        "Either way, there will be bloodshed.",
        "Caesar has warned me, Claudia.",
        "Warned me twice.",
        "He swore that the next time the blood would be mine.",
        "That is my truth!",
        "Herod refuses to condemn the man.",
        "They're bringing him back here.",
        "We're going to need reinforcements.",

        "Which of the two men would you have me release to you?",
        "The murderer Barabbas?",

        "He is not the Messiah!",
        "He is an imposter!",
        "A blasphemer!",
        "Free Barabbas!",

        "Free Barabbas!",
        "Free him.",

        "Have him crucified!",

        "I have the power to crucify you, or else to set you free.",
        "You have no power over me except what is given you from above.",
        "Therefore, it is he who delivered me to you who has the greater sin.",
        "If you free him, Governor you are no friend of Caesar's.",

        "If you are the son of God, why don't you save yourself?",
        "Prove to us you are who you say you are.",
        "You said you could destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days and yet you cannot come down from that cross.",
        "If he is the Messiah I say let him come down from the cross so that we may see and believe.",
        "Father, forgive them they know not what they do.",
        "Listen he prays for you.",
        "We deserve this, Gesmas but he does not.",
        "I have sinned and my punishment is just.",
        "You would be justified in condemning me.",
        "I ask only that you remember me, Lord when you enter your kingdom.",

        "Tell us who.",

        "I'm the last left alive.",
        "Whether that's a blessing or a curse who by Hades would know.",
        "But I've paid my price in blood.",
        "And in broken dreams.",
        "They say we were the greatest fighting force ever known to man.",
        "Greater even than the expedition to Troy.",
        "But how can I say it?",
        "How can I tell you what it is like to be young and to dream big dreams?",
        "To believe when Alexander looked you in the eye, you could do anything.",
        "Anything.",
        "In his presence, by the light of Apollo, we were better than ourselves.",
        "Truly, I've known many great men in my life but only one colossus.",
        "And only now, when old do I understand who this force of nature really was.",
        "Or do I?",
        "Did such a man as Alexander exist?",
        "Of course not.",
        "We idolize him, make him better than he was.",
        "Men, all men, reach and fall reach and fall.",
        "In the East, the vast Persian Empire ruled almost all the known world.",
        "In the West, the once great Greek city-states Thebes, Athens, Sparta, had fallen from pride.",
        "For 100 years now, the Persian kings had bribed the Greeks with their gold to fight as mercenaries.",
        "It was Philip, the one-eyed, who changed all this uniting tribes of illiterate sheepherders from the high and lowlands.",
        "With his blood and guts, he built a professional army that brought the devious Greeks to their knees.",
        "He then turned his eye on Persia where it was said the Great King Darius himself on his throne in Babylon, feared Philip.",
        "Philip was murdered much to Persia's delight and perhaps sponsored by their gold.",
        "And Alexander, at 20 became the new ruler of Macedonia.",
        "Announcing revenge for the death of Philip Alexander liberated all of the cities of western Asia south to Egypt where he was declared Pharaoh of Egypt and worshipped as a god.",
        "And finally, he provoked the rise to battle in the heart of the Persian Empire, near Babylon.",
        "It was mad.",
        "Forty thousand of us against hundreds of thousands of barbarian races unknown to us gathered under Darius himself.",
        "East and west had now come together to decide the fate of the known world.",
        "It was the day Alexander had waited for all his life.",
        "Son of a god.",
        "It was a myth, of course.",
        "At least it started as a myth.",
        "I know.",
        "I was there.",
        "In the crack of the Persian line, we'll go for the head.",
        "Kill Darius?",
        "The gods have brought him to us at last.",
        "If I die, it's one Macedonian.",
        "But the Persians, they cannot move without Darius' command.",
        "Here.",
        "Right here, we cut the throat of the Persian army.",
        "This is madness.",
        "You'll never get within 100 paces of him.",
        "Have you seen the sheer size of his force?",
        "Not if you hold them on the left, my brave Parmenion with your son Philotas for just one, two hours tomorrow.",
        "And you, unbreakable Antigonus, the center phalanx.",
        "Perdiccas, Leonnatus Nearchus, Polyperchon.",
        "If you pin them on the walls of your sarissas, here in the center their cavalry will follow me out to the right.",
        "And when bold Cassander breaks, stretching their left a hole will open.",
        "Then I and my cavalry-",
        "Our revered Cleitus Ptolemy and Hephaistion.",
        "Will strike through that gap and deal the deathblow to Darius' head.",
        "Since when, by the light of Apollo, has cavalry been used to break an infantry line?",
        "What was it we did to Chaeronea, Parmenion?",
        "Alexander, even with luck, timing, the gods, they're at least five to our one which means in truth we must rout them tomorrow, destroy their army completely.",
        "Or we'll be picked apart by bandit tribes on the long journey home.",
        "Right.",
        "You speak of home and retreat but do you understand, Parmenion?",
        "Babylon's my new home.",
        "Alexander if we must fight do so with stealth.",
        "Use your numbers well.",
        "We should attack tonight when they least expect us.",
        "I didn't cross Asia to steal this victory, Cassander.",
        "No, you are too honorable for that.",
        "No doubt influenced from sleeping with Tales of Troy under your pillow.",
        "But your father was no lover of Homer's.",
        "The lands west of the Euphrates, Alexander, the hand of his daughter in marriage.",
        "Since when has a Greek been given such honors?",
        "There are not honors, Parmenion, they're bribes which the Greeks have accepted too long.",
        "Do you forget that the man who murdered my father lies across the valley floor?",
        "- Come, Alexander we're still not really sure if it was Persian gold behind the assassination.",
        "But that is no matter!",
        "Your father taught you never to surrender your reason to your passion.",
        "Now I urge you with all my experience, regroup.",
        "Fall back to the coast, raise a larger force.",
        "I would, if I were Parmenion.",
        "But I am Alexander.",
        "And no more than Earth has two suns will Asia bear two kings.",
        "These are my terms.",
        "And if Darius isn't a coward who hides behind his men then he'll come to me tomorrow.",
        "And when he bows down to Greece Alexander will be merciful.",
        "By Ares' chains, he has got balls, men.",
        "I mean, give the man his due, Parmenion.",
        "And, lads, feast tonight, for tomorrow we will dine in Hades.",
        "I've seen one before.",
        "It was still alive.",
        "To whom do you pray?",
        "Phobos.",
        "Fear?",
        "A bad omen.",
        "More so for Darius.",
        "I've come to believe the fear of death drives all men, Hephaistion.",
        "And this we didn't learn as schoolboys.",
        "It is the cause of all of our misfortunes.",
        "- So, mighty Crateros.",
        "- Your Majesty.",
        "- Are you ready for tomorrow?",
        "- It's been too long coming if you ask me.",
        "The men are skittish as colts and the damn bulls won't shut their snouts.",
        "Good.",
        "Fear makes men fight better.",
        "Post your sentries alertly but rest them well.",
        "Don't you worry, general.",
        "I'm known to sleep with my eyes open as a baby's arse.",
        "Only because someone might steal his loot, sire.",
        "Well, someone owes Crateros for his cheapness.",
        "He buys neither gloves nor blankets to warm himself.",
        "Who needs gloves when you come from grace?",
        "Who needs clothes when you can fight naked?",
        "He's right.",
        "After tomorrow, even the thrifty among you shall be kings.",
        "- The gods are with us, Your Majesty.",
        "- We'll stain the ground in Persian blood, my king.",
        "You're on the first row tomorrow, boy.",
        "I've always believed, Alexander but this seems so much bigger than us.",
        "Did Patroclus doubt Achilles when they stood side by side at the seat of Troy?",
        "Patroclus died first.",
        "If you do...",
        "If you were to fall, Hephaistion, even if Macedonia were to lose a king I will avenge you.",
        "And follow you down to the house of death.",
        "I would do the same.",
        "On the eve of battle, it's hardest to be alone.",
        "Then perhaps...",
        "Perhaps this is farewell then my Alexander.",
        "Fear not, Hephaistion.",
        "We are at the beginning.",
        "Blood makes the world rise.",
        "Blood makes the rain fall.",
        "Blood makes the earth grow.",
        "And in blood, all men are born and die.",
        "Blood is the food of the gods below.",
        "Come, Bucephalus.",
        "Today we ride to our destiny.",
        "Company, group!",
        "Regroup!",
        "Phalanx, turn right!",
        "Phalanx, attention!",
        "Neoptolemus.",
        "I remember you the day you took the siege tower at Tyre.",
        "You were a giant.",
        "And today, how will you fight?",
        "Dexippos, by Athena.",
        "How far was it you threw your man wrestling at the last Olympic Games?",
        "Will you match it with your spear?",
        "And Timander, son of Menander, a great soldier to my father.",
        "I still mourn your brother, Addaios, who died so bravely at Halicarnassus.",
        "What an honored family you descend from, Timander.",
        "You fight for them today.",
        "You've all honored your country and your ancestors.",
        "And now we come to this most distant place in Asia where across from us, Darius has at last gathered a vast army...",
        "But ask yourselves who is this great king who pays assassins in gold coins to murder my father, our king in a most despicable and cowardly manner?",
        "Who is this great king, Darius, who enslaves his own men to fight?",
        "Who is this king but a king of air?",
        "These men do not fight for their homes.",
        "They fight because this king tells them they must.",
        "And when they fight, they will melt away like the air because they know no loyalty to a king of slaves.",
        "But we are not here today as slaves.",
        "We are here today as Macedonian freemen!",
        "And though outnumbered I say to you who know the price of tyranny who've carried the Persian yoke too long you have a strength born of your hearts and all their arms, their numbers their chariots and all their fine horses will mean nothing in the hands of slaves.",
        "Some of you perhaps myself will not live to see the sun set over these mountains today.",
        "For I will be in the very thick of battle with you.",
        "But remember this:",
        "The greatest honor a man can ever achieve is to live with great courage and to die with his countrymen in battle for his home.",
        "I say to you what every warrior has known since the beginning of time.",
        "Conquer your fear and I promise you, you will conquer death.",
        "And someday I vow to you your sons and your grandsons will look into your eyes.",
        "And when they ask why you fought so bravely at Gaugamela you will answer with all the strength of your great, great hearts:",
        "\"I was here this day at Gaugamela for the freedom and glory of Greece!\"",
        "Zeus be with us!",

        "He is a deeply selfish man.",
        "Would you say the love between Achilles and Patroclus is a corrupting one?",
        "When men lie together in lust, it is a surrender to the passions and does nothing for the excellence in us.",
        "Nor does any other excess, Cassander, jealousy among them.",
        "But when men lie together, and knowledge and virtue are passed between them that is pure and excellent.",

        "A woman?",
        "Of course not.",
        "A woman is a slave to her passion, Hephaistion.",
        "Oh, naturally there are exceptions, and we must honor them.",
        "Such as Pallas Athena, goddess of wisdom and war.",
        "But never forget, she is sprung not from the loins of Zeus, but from his mind.",
        "Now, you think on all this, my young frogs for in you resides the future of Greek civilization.",

        "Is it possible that the source of Egypt's mighty River Nile could rise in these distant mountains of the outer earth?",
        "If so, an experienced navigator could find his way here by this river east, down into the great plains of India out into the eastern ocean at end of the world and by this route up the Nile back to Egypt, into the Middle Sea and home to Greece.",
        "Now, if only these frogs could look outward and act on their favored position at the center Greece could rule the world.",
        "Why is it, master, in myth, these lands you speak of are known?",
        "India, where Herakles and Dionysus traveled.",
        "All these men who went east, Theseus, Jason, Achilles, were victorious.",

        "My father long wants it.",
        "The East has a way of swallowing men and their dreams.",

        "It's just a trick of Apollo's.",
        "He's the god of the sun.",

        "And you, as well as I, know that as the years decline and the memories stale and all your great victories fade it will always be remembered, you left your king in Asia!",

        "Where are your daggers?",
        "In smashing the mutiny and executing the ringleaders he did nothing, to my mind, that any general in wartime would not have done.",
        "But clearly, the army was divided. And Alexander was no longer loved by all.",
        "He drove on, south to the outer ocean.",
        "I confess a disappointment.",
        "Especially on these reports of your taking on Eastern ways.",
        "Beware how these manners inflame the senses with pride.",
        "However, I have lived long enough now to question when so many others invest such emotion in their disrespect for you.",
        "I can only hope that you continue what you began as the boy I knew at 12.",
        "Be that man always, Alexander, and you will not slip.",
        "And perhaps you will prove this old materialist as you always thought me:",

        "This is all part of a gigantic ploy.",
        "I allowed the enemy to invade the Reich.",
        "They believe they've won, but you'll see, Greim.",
        "It'll be a rude awakening for them.",
        "D\u00f6nitz is mobilizing troops in the north, Kesselring in the south.",
        "We will crush the enemy in a massive pincer movement.",

        "Insane!",

        "My lady",
        "They are to escort the merchant ship",
        "I selected the most skilled officers",
        "We excluded those who couldn't fare well at sea",
        "What happened to the shipbuilders we sent to Mujinju?",
        "They must be repairing the ship",
        "We have also built a new chaser ship",
        "It's being prepared for launch at Chunghae Harbor",
        "I'll inspect the ship myself",
        "Get ready to patrol the Palgeum waters",
        "Yes, sir",
        "- Captain",
        "- What is it?",
        "We caught a spy",
        "On him, we found a detailed map showing Chunghae naval bases and our base",
        "Who are you working for?",
        "Confess!",
        "Who are you working for?",
        "Even torture has failed to open his mouth",
        "He must be a pirate",
        "We'll spare your life if you talk",
        "How can I trust you?",
        "I'll die anyway Just kill me now",
        "If they're trying to learn the location of naval bases, the pirates could be planning to attack Chunghae",
        "They know we'll be escorting a merchant ship from Mujinju",
        "We can't guarantee our safety if our force is divided",
        "If Chunghae is attacked by pirates, all our efforts will have been in vain",
        "We must come up with a plan",
        "Chunghae is not their target Their target is the merchant ship",
        "We'll escort the merchant ship as planned",
        "I'll discuss the defense of Chunghae with the governor",
        "Tighten the security around the harbor with the remaining officers",
        "Yes, sir",
        "Pass",
        "Pass",
        "- What are you thinking about?",
        "- I know I've seen her before",
        "Who?",
        "It's her Lady Jung-hwa",
        "I saw Lady Jung-hwa at Chunghae Harbor",
        "Snap out of it Are you seeing things now?",
        "I'm sure of it",
        "If Lady Jung-hwa were in Chunghae, she would surely know we're in Chunghae and if she did, she'd have come to see Captain Jang by now",
        "Forget this nonsense",
        "By the way, for this mission you should stay behind",
        "Lieutenant",
        "I can't stand to see you get hurt again",
        "I'll wipe out the pirates You stay with Lady Chae-ryung",
        "- I can't do that",
        "- What?",
        "Women are entitled to have goals too",
        "I came to Chunghae to wipe out pirates, and I'll do my duty",
        "You'd better listen to me If you don't, we're through",
        "That won't stop me",
        "So stubborn",
        "You know my parents were killed by pirates, don't you?",
        "Yes",
        "I know you're worried about me",
        "But if I don't avenge their deaths with my own hands,",
        "- I'll never rest easy",
        "- I know how you feel, but I'm worried you'll be in danger",
        "You should stay by my side at all times during the mission,",
        "- Okay?",
        "- Okay",
        "- What are you doing here?",
        "- Lady Jung-hwa is here",
        "Have you been well, my lord?",
        "I hear you have frequent outings",
        "Are you enjoying your stay in Chunghae?",
        "I understand now why you recommended Chunghae to me",
        "I have just arrived here, but I have already forgotten everything in the imperial city",
        "I heard you have entrusted Jang Bogo with the escort of your ship",
        "- Have you met him yet?",
        "- No, I have not",
        "You entrusted him with such an important task without having even met him?",
        "I have known Captain Jang very well for a long time",
        "I have worked as Madam Jami's chief in Yangzhou",
        "I know Captain Jang from the Sul Pyong Group",
        "What is your opinion of him?",
        "Do you think I can trust him?",
        "But you have already begun to trust him",
        "You're reading me like a book",
        "The merchant ship will leave Dukjin Harbor, and pass through Palgeum and Sadang waters",
        "Where will you attack them?",
        "I'll attack them on land, not at sea",
        "Attack them on land?",
        "What do you mean?",
        "Jang Bogo will be well prepared for a naval attack",
        "First, we'll attack the ship while it is passing through Sadang waters, and lure them ashore",
        "Then we'll ambush them from both land and sea",
        "It is the best strategy for suppressing them, and seizing their goods instantly",
        "But the strength of Jang Bogo's men in land battles was well proven in the Wu Ning Jun",
        "As you know, our men are helpless on land",
        "Jang Bogo also has skilled navigators and a navy",
        "We can inflict damage on them in a naval battle, but we can't wipe them out",
        "This is our chance to get rid of Jang Bogo, and suppress the Sul Pyong Group",
        "Can you do it?",
        "I'll personally select and train men for this mission",
        "Please have faith in me",
        "He's the leader of the Yumcha pirate gang",
        "This is Head Chief Yum Moon",
        "I'm Man-chool",
        "You must know why I am here",
        "If you prove your skills to me, you'll be at the vanguard of our attack, and the spoils of war will go to you",
        "You, You",
        "And you",
        "Take them to headquarters",
        "The rest are useless",
        "Even the few selected men will be no match for Jang Bogo's men in land battles",
        "Kneel!",
        "You have a death wish?",
        "Do you know who this is?",
        "How dare you glare at him?",
        "Who put you up to this?",
        "Head Chief",
        "- Do you know who this is?",
        "- Yes",
        "He served Hyo-baek before you conquered the island",
        "Were you trying to avenge your master?",
        "- Kill me",
        "- I'll slay him",
        "- Stand back",
        "- Head Chief",
        "Madam, Chief Kwon will accept your offer",
        "You have made a wise decision",
        "I heard you worked very closely with Jung-hwa",
        "- Is that right?",
        "- Yes",
        "Then you must know how she built her group",
        "She is a great businesswoman, and all the chiefs obey her every word",
        "Great business acumen alone couldn't have caused her business to expand this rapidly Someone must be watching her back",
        "Who is it?",
        "Tell me",
        "It is the former regent...",
        "Lord Kim Woo-jing",
        "- How does Jung-hwa know him?",
        "- We don't know how but when he came to Mujinju recently, the regent had a visit with Lady Jung-hwa",
        "No matter how I pondered, I couldn't understand",
        "Why Kim Woo-jing was going to Chunghae Now I understand",
        "Jung-hwa's father served as the Chunghae governor once",
        "He must trust her deeply if he'd take her advice and go to Chunghae",
        "The regent wasn't very friendly toward you",
        "If the regent is sponsoring her, she'll be a big threat to you",
        "- Captain, it's me, Tae-bong",
        "- Come in",
        "What is it?",
        "The minister of the military is here",
        "My lord, what a surprise this is",
        "Have you been well?",
        "Yes, and I owe it all to you",
        "What brings you to Mujinju?",
        "I have come to deliver a royal command",
        "His Majesty has ordered the former regent to return to the imperial city",
        "But he has retired from his post",
        "His Majesty has complete trust in Kim Woo-jing",
        "I believe your relationship with Kim Woo-jing is less than amicable",
        "Yet he has sent you with his message?",
        "What did the inspector general say about this?",
        "He was hesitant to bring Kim Woo-jing back to the imperial city, but he couldn't disobey His Majesty",
        "His majesty intends to appoint him as the regent again",
        "I came to Mujinju not to deliver the royal command, but to get rid of Kim Woo-jing",
        "If Kim Woo-jing becomes the regent,",
        "Jung-hwa will be a bigger threat to you",
        "You must put a stop to it",
        "Send a message to Master Yi",
        "Let him down",
        "Will you come under my command?",
        "Answer him!",
        "- Tie him up again",
        "- Yes, sir",
        "He holds a deep grudge against you",
        "Why do you spare him when you can slay him?",
        "If he came under my command willingly, I'd have killed him by now",
        "Will you really make him one of your subordinates?",
        "He's skilled in the martial arts If I can make him my man, he'll be a great asset to me",
        "Head Chief",
        "- What is it?",
        "- The master is looking for you",
        "You were looking for me?",
        "I need you to go to Mujinju",
        "What is it?",
        "Madam Jami wants to meet with you.",
        "Since you saved my life in Yangzhou years ago,",
        "I'll come to your aid this time",
        "I'll take care of Kim Woo-jing",
        "- Do you have a plan?",
        "- Leave it to me",
        "His Majesty has commanded that he return to the imperial city as soon as possible",
        "How could a dead man return to the imperial city?",
        "You have not heard or seen anything",
        "I have faith in you",
        "If anything goes wrong, we won't escape harm",
        "How could you accomplish anything with such a faint heart?",
        "If this goes well, you'll win the trust of the inspector general",
        "Do you mean to waste this valuable opportunity?",
        "I'm sorry",
        "I plan to let Yum Moon take care of this matter",
        "- He is in Shilla?",
        "- Yes.",
        "As you must know, Jang Bogo has set up a base in Chunghae in preparation for suppressing pirates",
        "It won't be easy to get into Chunghae when the security along the shore and harbor must've been tightened",
        "You only need to help Yum Moon get into Chunghae",
        "Yes, madam",
        "I need to ask you something",
        "Have you heard any news of Jung-hwa?",
        "- Have you?",
        "- No",
        "Jung-hwa is in Mujinju",
        "She has become the head of a merchant group, and is invading my share of the market",
        "That can't be.",
        "Jung-hwa couldn't do that to you",
        "Ask her yourself why she's doing this",
        "The reason I must get rid of Kim Woo-jing is because he's the one backing Jung-hwa",
        "I...",
        "I will never forgive Jung-hwa",
        "Since I know you had feelings for Jung-hwa,",
        "I was worried you'd reject my offer",
        "Even if it weren't for your proposition,",
        "I must kill Jang Bogo with my own hands someday",
        "Even if Jang Bogo was escorting your merchant ship,",
        "I'd have attacked the ship",
        "Are the preparations for the mission going well?",
        "We're doing all we can You needn't worry",
        "There is something else you must do for me before you get rid of Jang Bogo",
        "You must know how Jang Bogo managed to stay in Shilla instead of returning to China, don't you?",
        "I hear that the former regent, Kim Woo-jing helped him",
        "His Majesty intends to bring him back to the imperial city and reappoint him as the regent",
        "If Kim Woo-jing becomes the regent,",
        "Jang Bogo will gain an even more powerful ally",
        "Kim Woo-jing is a source of trouble for you and me both",
        "You should get rid of Kim Woo-jing",
        "Father!",
        "What?",
        "Have you seen a ghost or something?",
        "- Yes, I saw a ghost",
        "- What are you saying?",
        "- Are you sure it was Yum Moon?",
        "- Yes, I'm sure it was Yum Moon",
        "Yon told me, Yum Moon jumped to his death off a cliff",
        "So how could a dead man come back alive?",
        "You must've seen a ghost",
        "Madam Jami met with Joong-dal days ago, and now she met with Yum Moon",
        "They must be up to no good again",
        "You didn't see anything",
        "You didn't see Joong-dal or Yum Moon",
        "- Okay?",
        "- But I saw them",
        "I think I have to go to Chunghae",
        "- Why?",
        "- I have to let Captain Jang know",
        "Can you make up an excuse for me to go to Chunghae?",
        "You have a death wish?",
        "Soon-jong, please let us lead a quiet life",
        "I don't want for anything else",
        "I just want our family to be warm and fed",
        "So please let us live quietly, okay, my boy?",
        "I don't care even if you don't help me I'll go to Chunghae",
        "Let Madam Jami find out She can only kill me",
        "How could you say that?",
        "You're a father now!",
        "- So you have to help me",
        "- Why, you!",
        "What did she want with you?",
        "She told me to assassinate Kim Woo-jing",
        "Kim Woo-jing?",
        "You mean the former regent?",
        "The king intends to reappoint him as the regent",
        "The king has no heir, Kim Woo-jing is a royal descendant who could become the next king when the king dies",
        "He is fighting for the throne with the inspector general, who Madam Jami is supporting",
        "Kim Woo-jing left the imperial city to avoid the political battle",
        "Master, we must reject her proposition",
        "We could lose everything we worked so hard for if we get involved in the political strife",
        "We have joined hands with Madam Jami for our grand scheme, but we need not do such things",
        "You need not do it if you don't want to",
        "- I'll do it",
        "- Head Chief",
        "Jang Bogo will gain more power if Kim Woo-jing becomes the regent",
        "We must get rid of him",
        "I'll give you a chance to get your revenge",
        "- Give him a sword",
        "- Head Chief",
        "I won't hold a sword Get your revenge",
        "If you don't want to submit to my command, you may leave this place",
        "You have done well",
        "I couldn't understand why you had set up a base in Chunghae, but now that I'm here, I understand",
        "This place is a perfect stronghold",
        "It's the perfect place to connect Japan and China",
        "What is the progress on your plans to suppress the pirates?",
        "Pirates in the Jinwol area have unified a dozen smaller pirate gangs, and become the dominant power",
        "I plan to first suppress the smaller pirate gangs under their command, and then attack the Jinwol pirates",
        "How does it feel to have returned home?",
        "I'd say this must be a triumphant homecoming for you",
        "I haven't done anything for Chunghae yet",
        "I remember the time you stowed away on my ship, asking me to take you to China",
        "You were a bold and insolent child, but you had spirit in your eyes",
        "China must have been a land of opportunity for you then, but you will realize your dreams in Chungae",
        "Wipe out those pirates who stand in your way, and establish our foundation here as soon as possible",
        "Yes, Master",
        "I plan to build an inn near the harbor",
        "- An inn?",
        "- Yes",
        "Chunghae will soon become the port-of-call for merchant ships from Japan and China",
        "They will rest and get their supplies here",
        "We must prepare for that by building a large inn",
        "Why don't we invest equally in that inn?",
        "Fine",
        "Madam Jami hasn't tried to thwart you?",
        "The ploy of Madam Jami and the Mujinju governor posed a great threat, but we have overcome it with the aid of Lord Kim Woo-jing, the former regent",
        "If he was the regent, then he is the most powerful man next to the king",
        "Yes",
        "And for what reason has he come to our aid?",
        "He didn't want anything in return",
        "He is residing in Chunghae now",
        "You should meet with him if opportunity permits",
        "Did you say Master Sul Pyong?",
        "Yes,",
        "I heard he's the biggest merchant in Yangzhou",
        "- Do you know him?",
        "- Yes",
        "He just arrived and he's meeting with Captain Jang",
        "It seems Captain Jang has set up his base in Chunghae for reasons other than just suppressing pirates",
        "They will establish their group's base in Chunghae",
        "Shouldn't they choose Dukjin Harbor for their base, since it's closer to Mujinju?",
        "Chunghae satisfies all the conditions for merchant ships from Japan and China to make it their port-of-call",
        "When Captain Jang establishes his base in Chunghae, it'll become even more prosperous than Dukjin Harbor",
        "That is why I'm planning to build an inn here",
        "- Did you have any luck fishing?",
        "- No fish will indulge me",
        "I saw a Chinese merchant ship in the harbor",
        "Master Sul Pyong of the Yangzhou merchant group is here",
        "- Sul Pyong?",
        "- Yes he is the most successful Shilla merchant in China",
        "Then I must meet with him",
        "- Arrange a meeting.",
        "- Yes, my lord",
        "Stop there",
        "I haven't seen you before Where are you from?",
        "- Yon!",
        "- Soon-jong",
        "What brings you to Chunghae?",
        "- Where is Captain Jang?",
        "- Why?",
        "What happened?",
        "I have to tell him something important",
        "- Yum Moon is really alive?",
        "- I'm sure of it",
        "I saw him meeting with Madam Jami with my own eyes",
        "Why was he meeting with Madam Jami?",
        "I wouldn't know",
        "An important minister is staying in Mujinju now",
        "Yum Moon came right after she met the minister with the Mujinju governor",
        "They must be up to something",
        "I must meet with the regent",
        "Captain",
        "What is it?",
        "Harbor patrol officers were killed by unidentified men",
        "- Did you have a nice outing?",
        "- Yes",
        "Why are you waiting out in the cold?",
        "Let's go inside",
        "My lord, watch out!",
        "Jung-hwa!",
        "Who's there!",
        "Is anyone there?",
        "Wake up Wake up!",
        "How is she?",
        "Wake up!",
        "Wake up!",
        "Failed?",
        "Is it because of Jung-hwa?",
        "Did you have a change of heart when you saw her?",
        "You have a death wish...?",
        "No",
        "You don't know who was wounded by the dagger, do you?",
        "Why are you only telling us this now?",
        "It deeply upsets me... to know that there will never be any place for me",
        "The sea belongs to you and I",
        "Madam Jami and the minister must have plotted your assassination.",
        "(PANTING)",
        "(BOTH MOANING)",
        "Oh, God.",
        "Well, what the hell happened?",
        "- We're an old married couple.",
        "- Mmm-hmm.",
        "(BOTH LAUGHING)",
        "Was it the pot?",
        "I don't think so, because we brought it with us from New York.",
        "- Yeah.",
        "- It's the same.",
        "What was that...",
        "What was that old movie?",
        "(LAUGHING) You know, Blame it on Rio.",
        "It has to be that, it has to be that.",
        "You got to feel my heart.",
        "(LAUGHS)",

        "After dinnertime.",
        "Oh, God.",
        "God, I'd love to live like this.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I'm willing, if you have enough money to stay in Brazil for the rest of our lives.",
        "I'll think about it.",
        "Okay.",
        "Do you think that's it, being away?",
        "- Yeah.",
        "- Yeah.",

        "Stu, what are you talking about?",
        "/ I don't care.",
        "Why the fuck do you want to steal his tiger?",

        "I don't believe you guys.",
        "Wait, how did you guys find us?",
        "One of you dropped your jacket, found it in the tiger's cage this morning.",

        "He's not with us no more.",
        "I know this is asking a lot, but do you think there's anyway that we could go...",
        "To your house and look around to see if there's any clues for our friend?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "How else do you think we're gonna get the tiger back anyway?",
        "Come on, Champ.",
        "I'm sorry?",
        "We're not gonna put it in the Bentley.",
        "You brought it here, you bring it back.",
        "What do you think?",
        "About 40 minutes?",
        "Don't make me come back for him.",
        "That was Mike Tyson./ No shit that was Mike Tyson.",
        "I'm just saying, he's still got it.",

        "We must have taken him up there on his mattress...",
        "As a prank so he'll wake up on the roof.",
        "It's like that time in summer camp.",
        "Remember when we moved...",
        "His sleeping bag out in the jetty in the lake?",
        "Which was hillarious.",
        "It's not so funny now, though cuz we forgot where we put him.",
        "You guys are fuckin' retarded.",

        "Because frankly you're wasting a little bit of time right now.",
        "You fucking asshole!",
        "Oh, my skin burns.",

        "He hit me.",
        "Then I hit him.",
        "- You hit him with a bicycle pump?",
        "- I had to.",
        "He's much bigger than me.",
        "He was going to beat me up.",
        "Elias, this is serious.",
        "He might go blind on one eye.",
        "Then he should leave people alone.",
        "Hi.",
        "- Hi, Marianne.",
        "- Where is Elias?",
        "- They are talking to the police.",
        "- What happened?",
        "It was a vicious assault.",
        "Apparently there was a knife involved.",
        "- That can't be right.",
        "- That doesn't sound like Christian.",
        "- They haven't found one.",
        "- What has this got to do with Elias?",
        "- Did Elias hit Sofus?",
        "- We don't know.",
        "The police are interviewing them, and then we will find out what happened.",
        "Is it true, that Sofus has been blinded?",
        "- Who told you that?",
        "- The police.",
        "No. He will have a headache, and probably get a scar, but he will be alright.",
        "It could have been much worse.",
        "Why didn't you tell me that he hit you?",
        "Then we could have talked to him and his parents.",
        "- A lot of kids saw it.",
        "- That's no answer.",
        "If I hadn't fought back, then everyone would think I was weak.",
        "Just tell me if he had a knife.",
        "I promise I won't tell anyone.",
        "He didn't have a knife.",
        "Stop asking.",
        "If you hit him, then he will hit you.",
        "It will never end.",
        "Don't you understand?",
        "That's how wars start.",
        "Not if you hit hard enough the first time.",
        "You don't know a damn thing about it.",
        "It's like that in every school.",
        "Now no one dares touch me.",
        "I'm not going to ask you about the knife again.",
        "You understand?",
        "But I want you to know that you can tell me everything.",
        "Understand?",
        "Yes.",
        "- It's me.",
        "- Hi.",
        "- Were you sleeping?",
        "- No.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "I'm at a discotheque.",
        "What do you want?",
        "Just talk.",
        "I'm bored without you.",
        "- Did you talk to Elias?",
        "- Of course.",
        "I miss you.",
        "Don't do that.",
        "I told you I was sorry.",
        "And I mean that from the bottom of my heart.",
        "I was quite proud of us actually.",
        "I was.",
        "Proud that we weren't like all the other idiots, who just give up and get divorced..",
        "I was proud that we loved each other.",
        "We still do.",
        "But Anton...",
        "I messed up big time.",
        "I tried...",
        "I tried to explain, how it got that far - and I was so stupid.",
        "I tried...",
        "You only paid attention to her, every time you were home.",
        "It still hurts.",
        "Everything we had together.",
        "And when you were here, it was all lies.",
        "It was all make-believe.",
        "I love you.",
        "I would like to forgive you, but I can't keep up.",
        "- That's how it is.",
        "Good night.",
        "- No, wait. Don't hang up.",
        "I think, we can consider this matter closed",
        "All of you messed up.",
        "But you have learned that no good comes from fighting.",
        "- That's right.",
        "- It could have ended much worse.",
        "Now Elias and Sofus shake hands.",
        "- I'm sorry, Elias.",
        "- Good.",
        "And Christian and Sofus.",
        "Please shake hands.",
        "Sorry.",
        "And you'll be back monday, no hard feelings, ok?",
        "- Looking forward to the theme week?",
        "- Yes.",
        "- The whole school is excited.",
        "- We're looking forward to it.",
        "- What will you be doing, Sofus?",
        "- I'm in the weapons group.",
        "- We'll be making muskets.",
        "- Of course you will.",
        "- And Elias?",
        "- I'm in the same group as Christian.",
        "We'll be making a model of The Round Tower.",
        "Want to walk with me, Christian?",
        "No.",
        "Come on, Elias.",
        "Here it is.",
        "- Do you want it?",
        "- Thanks.",
        "Cool!",
        "- Christian?",
        "- Yes?",
        "I'm leaving now.",
        "I'll try to make the flight at four tomorrow.",
        "I'll call you.",
        "- You can stay for dinner, if you want?",
        "- Thank you, but I should be going home.",
        "- Then maybe in the weekend.",
        "- Just go, dad.",
        "See you.",
        "- Take care, Elias.",
        "- You too.",
        "- Where's he going?",
        "- London.",
        "- Where's your mom?",
        "- She's dead.",
        "My parents are in the middle of a divorce.",
        "- Why did she die?",
        "- She had cancer.",
        "At first they thought, she'd get well, but she didn't make it.",
        "- She was cremated.",
        "- Okay.",
        "Funerals are disgusting.",
        "The bodies rot and seep into the groundwater.",
        "I want to be cremated when I'm dead.",
        "What about you?",
        "Perhaps.",
        "I never really thought about it.",
        "- What are we doing here?",
        "- Going up.",
        "- You can do that?",
        "- of course.",
        "Come on.",
        "- Wow, this is crazy.",
        "- Yeah.",
        "I use to come here when I was home on vacation.",
        "- Where's your house?",
        "- My house?",
        "- Out there somewhere.",
        "- Okay.",
        "It's a long way down.",
        "Yeah, like that.",
        "We were on this silo down by the docks.",
        "You can't do that.",
        "Christian is up there every day.",
        "You can see our house from up there.",
        "I know it.",
        "That's why I tell you not play there",
        "It's dangerous.",
        "Promise me that you won't do it again.",
        "Don't \"mmm\" me.",
        "Promise.",
        "- Where's the pump?",
        "- Here you go.",
        "- Promise?",
        "- Yeah.",
        "- Promise what?",
        "- That I won't go back up there.",
        "Let's pump it up.",
        "- Put it down here, boys.",
        "- Can we have an ice cream?",
        "- Yes.",
        "Put it down gently.",
        "- I wanna try the swing.",
        "Thanks for the help.",
        "Kayaking was so much fun.",
        "- Don't!",
        "- Come on, boys.",
        "Hey!",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Morten!",
        "Stop that.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Why are you fighting?",
        "- What's going on?",
        "- He took my swing.",
        "- Why?",
        "- He punched me for no reason.",
        "- Why did you hit him?",
        "- I didn't.",
        "- Why are you fighting over a swing?",
        "- What's going on here, man?",
        "I was just using the swing, and he came up and started bothering me.",
        "- Don't steal his swing!",
        "- Kids will be kids...",
        "I don't wanna see you touch my boy again.",
        "You understand?",
        "- I didn't touch him.",
        "- Get the hell outta here.",
        "Fuck off!",
        "What the hell is wrong with you?",
        "Look at me.",
        "You're always fighting.",
        "Always fucking trouble with you.",
        "- I'm sorry, dad.",
        "- You did nothing wrong.",
        "Doesn't it hurt?",
        "Are we going to the hospital?",
        "- No, we're not.",
        "- I'm very sorry.",
        "- Shouldn't you call the police?",
        "- Yeah, dad.",
        "Call the police.",
        "- No, I won't do that.",
        "- He hit you.",
        "Let's go home.",
        "You can't eat your ice cream in the car.",
        "End of discussion.",
        "- We shouldn't be up here.",
        "- Why not?",
        "- What are you doing?",
        "- Just hanging out.",
        "I gotta get home.",
        "- There he is.",
        "- Who?",
        "The idiot, who hit your dad.",
        "Come on.",
        "- There he is.",
        "- We'll look up his address online.",
        "- Hey!",
        "What the hell are you doing?",
        "- Run dammit!",
        "- Hey dad.",
        "- Hey.",
        "Come, sweetheart.",
        "- You okay?",
        "- Sure.",
        "- What are you doing here?",
        "- I just wanted to give you this.",
        "I know where the guy who punched you works.",
        "- How did you find out?",
        "- I just did.",
        "He works there.",
        "How did you find out?",
        "Christian and I saw him.",
        "It was on his car.",
        "- Have you been up on that silo again?",
        "Christian might have been.",
        "He's up there every day.",
        "- But you haven't?",
        "- I haven't.",
        "- Are you sure?",
        "- Yeah.",
        "Aren't you going to do something about it?",
        "- Like what?",
        "- Go and beat him up.",
        "- Are you serious?",
        "- Yes.",
        "- Are you afraid?",
        "- That's not the point.",
        "You don't go around beating people up.",
        "Nobody benefits from that.",
        "What kind of world would we live in then?",
        "He's an idiot.",
        "If I beat him up, I'll be just as big an idiot.",
        "I'll go to jail, and you'll have no dad.",
        "He wins.",
        "Maybe mom would like it, if you weren't such a wimp.",
        "I promised mom I'd be home, so I better get going.",
        "Who's the wimp now?",
        "You are.",
        "- Bye!",
        "- Say hi to your mom.",

        "Sweden calling.",
        "- Hi.",
        "- Hi.",
        "Remember me?",
        "I'm Anton.",
        "We met on the playground.",
        "You slapped me.",
        "Remember?",
        "Yeah, I remember.",
        "- What do you want?",
        "- Why did you do it?",
        "- Don't touch my kids.",
        "- I broke up a fight over a swing.",
        "Good for you.",
        "Know what you should do?",
        "Stay away from me and my son.",
        "And nothing will happen.",
        "Okay?",
        "You understand?",
        "Do you want me to tell you why you did it?",
        "No, shut the hell up.",
        "And get your ass back to Sweden.",
        "- Nobody understands you here anyway.",
        "- Did you hit me because you could?",
        "- That's right.",
        "- Maybe you should shut up now, Lars.",
        "Do you want me to hit you again?",
        "You're an idiot, who likes to feel you're in charge.",
        "- You're not.",
        "- Stop it, Lars.",
        "- It's alright, boys.",
        "- What do you want?",
        "What do I want?",
        "I want to show the children that I'm not afraid of you.",
        "- You can't hurt me.",
        "- You're not afraid of me?",
        "And I can't hurt you?",
        "That's exactly what I can do.",
        "I think you should go now.",
        "Take your kids, and go home.",
        "- You frightened the children, when you hit me.",
        "- Good.",
        "They were very upset, and found out where you work.",
        "That's why we're here.",
        "That's very clever of them, finding out where I work.",
        "Good job.",
        "You're such a big idiot, that you can't even apologize when I'm here with the kids, but continue to fight.",
        "- Huh?",
        "Want some more?",
        "- Let's go home.",
        "Want some more?",
        "Get the hell back to Sweden, you fag.",
        "It didn't hurt.",
        "I'm okay.",
        "Let's go.",
        "Thank you for seeing us.",
        "It didn't hurt.",
        "Nothing to be afraid of.",
        "That's all he knows how to do.",
        "He lost.",
        "He's a moron.",
        "You understand?",
        "Understand what?",
        "That he's a moron, and not worth our time.",
        "- He's a big moron.",
        "- Exactly.",
        "I don't think he feels he lost.",
        "- Maybe not, but he did.",
        "- I'm not sure.",
        "- Let's go.",
        "We're done here.",
        "- Giant wanker moron.",
        "- Get in the car.",
        "- He was such an asshole.",
        "- Giant wanker moron.",
        "- That's enough.",
        "- Giant wanker moron!",
        "- Put your seatbelt on.",
        "Alright, stop.",
        "- Should we let Morten try?",
        "- Yes!",
        "Wait a second.",
        "There.",
        "Come on, Morten.",
        "Perfect!",
        "No, let go at the same time.",
        "Look at that.",
        "- Has the fever gone down?",
        "- Yeah, it's gone down.",
        "That's perfect.",
        "There he is.",
        "Everybody's afraid of him, but no one does anything about it.",
        "I'll try to find something we can use as a fence.",
        "Come here for a second.",
        "Must be something my granddad bought.",
        "We shouldn't keep it here.",
        "It could blow up the whole house.",
        "- They're just fireworks.",
        "- You know how much black powder's in this?",
        "Several pounds.",
        "- You could make a huge bomb.",
        "- Really?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I'll show you online.",
        "He just kept hitting your dad.",
        "Your dad might not be afraid, but he just kept hitting him.",
        "If we get back at him, he might learn his lesson.",
        "- How loud will this be?",
        "- Very.",
        "- Won't anyone hear?",
        "- Not out here.",
        "Hold the bomb.",
        "You want to light it?",
        "You'll have to run.",
        "- You do it.",
        "- Are you sure?",
        "- Run fast, ok?",
        "- Yeah.",
        "Fuck, that was sick!",
        "Imagine if we use one of the big ones!",
        "His car will be blown to pieces.",
        "- Whose car?",
        "- That asshole, Lars'.",
        "- You want to blow up his car?",
        "- Sure.",
        "Someone will find out.",
        "A car is really expensive.",
        "- Your dad will be pleased.",
        "- I'm not so sure.",
        "Doesn't matter.",
        "No one will find out.",
        "Are you in or out?",
        "I'm not sure...",

        "- Stretcher!",
        "Stretcher!",

        "- You want to, I can tell.",
        "You achieve nothing by acting like this.",
        "- You said we should talk.",
        "- Stop it, right now!",
        "Stop thinking and saying crap like that.",
        "- It's not crap!",
        "- It's crap!",

        "Yeah, I'm okay.",
        "I read the teleporter's mind.",
        "Shaw is drawing all the power out of his sub.",
        "He's turning himself into some kind of nuclear bomb.",
        "We got no time. The geiger count is going out of control.",
        "Moira, this is what we're gonna do.",
        "Get on the radio and tell them to clear both fleets out immediately.",
        "I'm going in.",
        "Beast, havok, back him up.",
        "Erik, I can guide you through once you're in, but I need you to shut down whatever it is that's blocking me, then we just hope to God it's not too late for me to stop him.",
        "Got it.",
        "Good luck!",

        "Fine.",
        "If we go, you go!",
        "We believe Shaw is trying to detonate some kind of bomb.",

        "He's got to be there.",
        "He has to be!",
        "There's nowhere else he can be. Keep looking.",
        "And I'm telling you he's not.",

        "Erik.",
        "What a pleasant surprise.",
        "Erik?",
        "Erik.",
        "So good to see you again.",
        "May I ask you something?",
        "Why are you on their side?",
        "He's gone. What?",
        "He's gone into the void!",
        "I can't communicate with him there.",
        "Why fight for a doomed race who will hunt us down as soon as they realize their reign is coming to an end?",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yes!",
        "I truly am.",
        "He's back!",
        "Erik, whatever you're doing, keep doing it.",
        "It's starting to work.",
        "But everything I did, I did for you.",
        "To unlock your power, to make you embrace it.",
        "It's working!",
        "I'm starting to see him, but I can't yet touch his mind.",
        "You've come a long way from bending gates.",
        "I'm so proud of you.",
        "And you're just starting to scratch the surface.",
        "Think how much further we could go together.",
        "Stop! Azazel.",
        "I don't want to hurt you, Erik.",
        "I never did.",

        "You are my creator.",
        "Now, Charles!",
        "Are you okay?",
        "Moira, be quiet.",
        "I can only control this man for so long.",

        "Be the better man.",
        "It's not that I don't trust you.",
        "Erik, there will be no turning back!",
        "No!",
        "Charles! Don't do this, Erik!",
        "If you're in there,",
        "I'd like you to know that I agree with every word you said.",
        "We are the future.",
        "But, unfortunately, you killed my mother.",
        "This is what we're going to do. No.",
        "Please, Erik, no.",

        "But the girl keeps secrets.",
        "It is not for a man to spoil them.",
        "You're one of them now.",
        "I should have let you burn.",
        "And you fetch water for one of them now.",
        "Why is this right for you and wrong for me?",
        "I didn't have a choice.",
        "You did.",
        "I did.",
        "And here we are.",
        "A man pays his debts.",
        "A man owes three.",
        "Three what?",
        "The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl.",
        "And only death may pay for life.",
        "You saved me and the two I was with.",
        "You stole three deaths from the Red God.",
        "We have to give them back.",
        "Speak three names and the man will do the rest.",
        "Three lives I will give you-- no more, no less, and we're done.",
        "I can name anyone and you'll kill him?",
        "A man has said.",
        "The one who tortures everyone.",
        "A man needs a name.",
        "I don't know his name.",
        "They call him the Tickler.",
        "That is enough.",
        "Go now, girl.",
        "Your master is thirsty.",
        "He's not here yet.",
        "He'd have seen us, blown the horn.",
        "When will he come?",
        "The Halfhand does things in his own time.",
        "My uncle told me stories about him.",
        "Most of them are true.",
        "I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the wall.",
        "The whole winter.",
        "He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came.",
        "Had to wait for the thaw.",
        "So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.",
        "Well, possible for the Halfhand.",
        "Beautiful, isn't it?",
        "Gilly would love it here.",
        "There's nothing more sickening than a man in love.",
        "About time you did something.",
        "At least you'll keep warm.",
        "The fist of the First Men.",
        "Think of how old this place is-- before the Targaryens defeated the Hendals, before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men.",
        "Before I die, please, stop talking.",
        "Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where we're standing all through the long night.",
        "What do you think they were like, the First Men?",
        "Stupid.",
        "Smart people don't find themselves in places like this.",
        "I think they were afraid.",
        "I think they came here to get away from something.",
        "And I don't think it worked.",
        "Wildlings?",
        "One blast is for rangers returning.",
        "Wildlings is two blasts.",
        "So you got to stand there waiting, wondering.",
        "One blast for friends, two for foes.",
        "And three for White Walkers.",
        "It's been 1,000 years, but that's the only time they blow the horn three times.",
        "But if it's been 1,000 years, how do you know?",
        "- Well...",
        "- I read it in a book.",
        "Look.",
        "It's Qhorin Halfhand.",
        "Aye, we'll live another day.",
        "Hurrah.",
        "Take care, My Lord.",
        "I remember reading an old sailor's proverb--",
        "\"piss on wildfire and your cock burns off.\"",
        "Oh, I have not conducted this experiment.",
        "It could well be true.",
        "The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel, and, of course, flesh.",
        "The substance burns so hot, it melts flesh like tallow.",
        "After the dragons died, wildfire was the key to the Targaryen power.",
        "My companion takes issue.",
        "If I could tell you how many crazy old men",
        "I've seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit...",
        "- No offense meant.",
        "- Our order does not deal in pig shit.",
        "The substance is fire given form.",
        "And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor.",
        "To do what?",
        "The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy.",
        "How much do you have?",
        "If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you'd hit your target one time in 10, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father.",
        "My Lord, this man is insulting.",
        "I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy.",
        "'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us.",
        "Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down.",
        "My friend remains unconvinced.",
        "He would not dare insult my order whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.",
        "Well, he's not living anymore.",
        "And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they?",
        "Men win wars, not magic tricks.",
        "We have been working tirelessly day and night ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so.",
        "Our present count stands at 7,811, enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet and armies both.",
        "This is a shit idea.",
        "I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, wisdom Hallyne.",
        "The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low.",
        "You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer.",
        "You'll be making it for me.",
        "Dracarys.",
        "Dracarys.",
        "He'll be able to feed himself from now on.",
        "Let him sleep, Doreah.",
        "Yes, Khaleesi.",
        "He loves you.",
        "Thank you, my friend.",
        "Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you?",
        "They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth.",
        "It is known.",
        "And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos--",
        "The last time a rich man gave me a dress, he was selling me to Khal Drogo.",
        "Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him.",
        "Men like to talk about other men when they're happy.",
        "You would look like a real princess in Xaro's--",
        "She's not a princess.",
        "She's a Khaleesi.",
        "You should wear it, Khaleesi.",
        "You are their guest.",
        "It would be rude not to.",
        "And you must visit the night market.",
        "The Qartheen night market is like no night market you've ever seen.",
        "It sounds wonderful.",
        "The Meereens think they have a night market.",
        "I will take you there myself.",
        "Please excuse me for a moment.",
        "What are they doing?",
        "Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry.",
        "Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot.",
        "They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold.",
        "Very soft.",
        "He can chop off as much as we can carry.",
        "My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built.",
        "It's not the only thing.",
        "They're quite good at killing the better men.",
        "That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.",
        "Mother of Dragons.",
        "On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth,",
        "I welcome you.",
        "A demonstration?",
        "Take this gem.",
        "Look at it.",
        "Into its depths.",
        "So many facets.",
        "Look closely enough and you can see yourself in them.",
        "Often more than once.",
        "Should you grow tired of Xaro's baubles and trinkets, it would be an honor to host you at the House of the Undying.",
        "You're always welcome,",
        "Mother of Dragons.",
        "My apologies.",
        "Pyat Pree is one of the Thirteen.",
        "It was customary for me to extend him an invitation.",
        "Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.",
        "What is the House of the Undying?",
        "It is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening.",
        "It turns their lips blue and their minds soft-- so soft, they actually believe their parlor tricks are magic.",
        "You watch over her.",
        "Do I know you?",
        "I know you.",
        "Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.",
        "Who are you?",
        "I'm no one.",
        "But she is the Mother of Dragons.",
        "She needs true protectors now more than ever.",
        "They shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again.",
        "And when they see, they shall lust, for dragons are fire made flesh.",
        "And fire is power.",
        "It looked like Stannis.",
        "To me it just looked like...",
        "A shadow in the shape of a man.",
        "In the shape of Stannis.",
        "We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.",
        "Will you stay there long, My Lady?",
        "Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen.",
        "After that, I will leave for Winterfell.",
        "My two youngest need me.",
        "I've been away from them for far too long.",
        "I never knew my mother.",
        "I'm sorry.",
        "My own mother died on the birthing bed when I was very young.",
        "It's a bloody business.",
        "What comes after is even harder.",
        "Once you're safely back amongst your own people, will you give me leave to go, My Lady?",
        "You mean to kill Stannis.",
        "I swore a vow.",
        "But Stannis has a great army around him.",
        "His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.",
        "I'm as good as any of them.",
        "I should never have fled.",
        "Renly's death was no fault of yours.",
        "You served him bravely.",
        "I only held him that once as he was dying.",
        "He's gone, Brienne.",
        "You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth.",
        "Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well.",
        "I do not know your son, My Lady... but I could serve you if you would have me.",
        "You have courage.",
        "Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I don't know, a woman's kind of courage.",
        "And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back.",
        "Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis.",
        "When the time comes, I will not hold you back.",
        "Then I am yours, My Lady.",
        "I will shield your back and give my life for yours if it comes to that.",
        "I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.",
        "I vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that I shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor.",
        "I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.",
        "And it's not just thieves, My Lord.",
        "There's wolves in them hills now, more than I've ever seen.",
        "They come down in the night and they kill my sheep.",
        "My three sons is away fighting for your brother, My Lord.",
        "They'll fight, keep fighting till they're told to go home.",
        "I have no one to man my flock now.",
        "Only me.",
        "I can't keep watch all day and all night.",
        "We can send two orphan boys from Winterstown home with you to help watch over your flock if you can give them room and board.",
        "My wife always prayed for more children.",
        "We'll look after them.",
        "Thank you, My Lord.",
        "And may the Gods bless you and yours.",
        "Stop it.",
        "If that's everyone, I'm going to go for a ride before dark.",
        "- Good.",
        "- Hodor.",
        "- Hodor.",
        "Bran-",
        "- Lord Stark.",
        "Torrhen's Square is under siege.",
        "Torrhen's Square is barely 40 leagues from here.",
        "How can the Lannisters strike so far north?",
        "Might be a raiding party led by the Mountain.",
        "Might be Sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.",
        "We have to help them.",
        "Most of the fighting men are away with Robb, but I can gather 200 decent men.",
        "Do you need so many?",
        "If we can't protect our own bannermen, why should they protect us?",
        "Go, Ser Rodrik.",
        "Take the men you need.",
        "Won't take long, My Lord.",
        "Southerners don't do well up here.",
        "So, what does it mean?",
        "Ask your Maester Luwin.",
        "He's the one studying books all the time.",
        "I did ask him.",
        "He'd never heard of a three-eyed raven.",
        "- Must not mean anything, then",
        "- You're lying.",
        "You might be a little lord, but don't you call me a liar.",
        "- You know what it means.",
        "- I never said I didn't.",
        "You didn't give me an honest answer.",
        "That's not the same as being a liar.",
        "Well, it's not far off.",
        "So, you've been dreaming of a three-eyed raven again?",
        "In the Godswood, you told me you didn't dream.",
        "Now who's a liar?",
        "What did you see in your dream?",
        "Something bad?",
        "Tell me, boy.",
        "I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell.",
        "I saw waves crashing against the gates and the water came flowing over the walls... flooded the castle.",
        "Drowned men were floating here in the yard.",
        "Ser Rodrik was one of them.",
        "The sea is hundreds of miles away.",
        "I know.",
        "It's just a stupid dream.",
        "I've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen.",
        "Otherwise they'll put me in chains again.",
        "Osha.",
        "The three-eyed raven, what do they say about it north of the wall?",
        "They say all sorts of crazy things north of the wall.",
        "- There.",
        "- Where?",
        "On that Mountain.",
        "I don't see very well.",
        "A fire.",
        "There's a fire.",
        "The people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine.",
        "When they see us coming, that fire becomes a signal.",
        "Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time.",
        "to throw a party in our honor.",
        "How many wildlings have joined him?",
        "From what we can tell, all of them.",
        "Mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves.",
        "They're almost ready to make their move.",
        "Where?",
        "Somewhere safe.",
        "Somewhere south.",
        "Can't just march into their midst.",
        "And we can't wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us.",
        "You saying we should fall back to the Wall?",
        "Mance was one of us once.",
        "Now he's one of them.",
        "He's gonna teach them our way of doing things.",
        "They'll hit us in force.",
        "And they won't run away when we hit back.",
        "They're gonna be more organized than before, more disciplined more like us.",
        "So we need to be more like them, do things their way.",
        "Sneak in, kill Mance, and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the Wall.",
        "And to do that...",
        "We need to get rid of those lookouts.",
        "It's not a job for 400 men.",
        "I need to move fast and silent.",
        "Harker, Stonesnake, Borba.",
        "Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin.",
        "I've been called lots of things, but that might be my first Lord Qhorin.",
        "You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger.",
        "I've fought and killed a Wight.",
        "How many rangers can say that?",
        "He's the one?",
        "Aye.",
        "You killed a Wight.",
        "You also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword.",
        "Craster?",
        "In the boy's defense, that's a tough old goat.",
        "I could take up Jon's duties while he's gone, My Lord.",
        "It would be no trouble.",
        "Well, I hope you make a better ranger than you do a steward.",
        "Go on.",
        "So, tell me, how long has your manservant been in love with you?",
        "He's not my manservant and he's not in love with me.",
        "He's my advisor, my friend.",
        "Unlikely.",
        "I can almost always tell what a man wants.",
        "And what about what a woman wants?",
        "Much more complicated.",
        "You, for example, what do you want?",
        "To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne.",
        "Why?",
        "Because I promised my Khalasar I'd protect them and find them a safe home.",
        "You want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms?",
        "I want them because they're mine by right.",
        "The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.",
        "Ah, a conqueror.",
        "And how did you get all of this?",
        "- Did someone give it to you?",
        "- No.",
        "I come from nothing.",
        "I hit the docks like a piece of cargo, except someone normally cares what happens to cargo.",
        "So you wanted more than you had and you took it.",
        "You're a conqueror, too.",
        "you're just less ambitious.",
        "Mmm.",
        "What do you want, Xaro Zhoan Daxos?",
        "At the gates of the city, you bled for me.",
        "Why?",
        "I will show you why.",
        "The door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone.",
        "The hardest steel does not make a mark.",
        "I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it.",
        "I made the same offer to the greatest thieves.",
        "They all went home empty-handed.",
        "The only thing that can open this door is this key.",
        "And behind the door?",
        "And it can all be mine?",
        "All?",
        "Let us say half.",
        "More than enough to buy horses, ships, armies-- enough to go home.",
        "All I have to do?",
        "Is marry me.",
        "That was a romantic proposal.",
        "I've already married once for love, but the Gods stole her from me.",
        "I come from nothing.",
        "My mother and father never owned a pair of shoes.",
        "But marry me and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms and our children will be Princes and Princesses.",
        "See?",
        "I have more ambition than you thought.",
        "The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen, first of your name.",
        "Robert Baratheon is dead.",
        "If you cross the sea with an army you bought--",
        "The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another.",
        "Four false kings destroying the country.",
        "To win Westeros, you need support from Westeros.",
        "The usurper is dead.",
        "The Starks fight the Lannisters, and Baratheons fight each other.",
        "According to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand?",
        "The time to strike is now.",
        "We need to find ships and an army or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world.",
        "Rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get.",
        "They'll give you ships and soldiers and they'll own you forever.",
        "Moving carefully is the hard way, but it's the right way.",
        "And if I'd listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth, we'd all be dead by now.",
        "I know the opportunity before you seems like the last you'll ever have, but you must--",
        "Do not speak to me like I'm a child.",
        "- I only want--",
        "- What do you want?",
        "Tell me.",
        "To see you on the Iron Throne.",
        "- Why?",
        "- You have a good claim.",
        "A title.",
        "A birthright.",
        "But you have something more than that.",
        "You may cover it up and deny it, but you have a gentle heart.",
        "You would not only be respected and feared, you would be loved.",
        "Someone who can rule and should rule.",
        "Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world.",
        "There are times when I look at you and still can't believe you're real.",
        "So what would you have me do as my advisor?",
        "Make your own way.",
        "Find your own ship.",
        "You only need one.",
        "The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth.",
        "And how do I get the ship?",
        "I'll find it for you.",
        "A sound ship with a good captain.",

        "No, I'll accept anyone in this world, but not him!",
        "He told you to do what ever I say, right?",
        "Go back to Delhi with mom and dad.",

        "You don't breathe in Herve.",
        "Follow me, Mr. Madison, Janice is waiting for you.",
        "Oh, my God.",
        "Who's that?",
        "You're killing me.",
        "You don't know who that is?",
        "No.",
        "The third largest social media inventor since Zuckerberg?",
        "Class-Meet?",
        "What planet are you from?",
        "What is he doing here?",
        "Please, don't tell me he's here to get fixed up by The Madam.",
        "She is no madam.",
        "You need to bite your tongue.",
        "She's a matchmaker and she's very good at her job.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So are pimps.",
        "Come.",
        "Please.",

        "I'm sure this handsome face has no problem getting dates.",
        "Well,",
        "I'm actually in between relationships right now.",
        "So you could use our services?",
        "Well, I prefer the old-fashioned way of meeting women.",
        "You like to pay?",
        "No, that's not what I meant.",
        "What exactly do you do?",
        "Me?",
        "Yes.",
        "I'm the in-house therapist.",
        "This is Judith.",

        "Well, Judith, you are who I'd like to speak to.",
        "Judith, Harley is looking to invest in my company.",
        "We want to take Wise Counsel online and international.",
        "Okay.",
        "Well, before I make that type of investment,",

        "Yes, ma'am.",
        "She'll be working the register and stocking the shelves.",
        "I check the register at random every day, so you're gonna have to account for every dime.",
        "- No problem.",
        "- Random!",
        "I got it.",
        "Brice tells me you're from Boston?",
        "Yeah.",
        "You don't sound like you come from Boston.",
        "Do you know Boston?",
        "No. I've never been there.",
        "Yet.",

        "So should I get to work?",
        "Yeah, there's a box of deodorant under the counter that needs to be restocked.",
        "Okay.",
        "Nice meeting you.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Hey-",
        "No husband?",

        "And those boots?",
        "She's a lesbian.",
        "Does it matter?",
        "I don't think people will think there's anything between us, but you never know.",
        "People talk.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Matchmaking.",
        "I don't know how I feel about all this.",
        "I'm sorry?",
        "Well, it's a dating service for the rich.",
        "I just...",
        "I'm not sure this is something I should be investing in.",
        "You know, it's kinda strange.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So you agree with that?",
        "A little bit.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So I shouldn't invest?",
        "I'm not saying that.",
        "I would never say that.",
        "Like you said, it's a little strange.",
        "A little odd.",
        "Little unnatural.",
        "Bunch of old guys paying to meet women.",
        "I'm gonna shut up.",
        "I'm saying too much.",
        "No, no, honestly, continue, please.",
        "I kind of prefer the old-fashioned way of finding love, but...",
        "Well, I completely agree.",
        "But, let me play devil's advocate.",
        "So, more than half of all new relationships are started online in this day and age.",
        "- Yeah.",
        "- Right.",
        "So it's obvious, she definitely...",
        "She has something going here.",
        "I'm just not sure exactly how I fit into it.",
        "That's why I'm here.",
        "To help you figure that out.",
        "I think we can start with the Wise Counsel questionnaire that I developed.",
        "And pretty much we use it to see whether or not someones compatible.",
        "Do I know you from somewhere?",
        "I doubt we run in the same circles.",
        "Do you run?",
        "Yeah, every day at...",
        "Landover Park.",
        "I knew it.",
        "You run there?",
        "8:00 a.m. every Saturday.",
        "Start at the wheelhouse...",
        "I think I have seen you run past me before.",
        "You're that cheesy guy always running with his shirt off and making grunts.",
        "- I'm not cheesy.",
        "- Yeah, you are.",
        "I get hot.",
        "No, you're running with your shirt off so all the pretty girls could notice you.",
        "Well, you noticed me, right?",
        "Turn to page two.",
        "You'll see the compatibility questionnaire.",
        "All business.",
        "I wanted to start with that.",
        "I like that.",
        "Hey, you.",
        "How was your third week?",
        "Any better?",
        "Oh, God.",
        "That bad, huh'?",
        "Honey, what am I doing there?",
        "I have a master's degree.",
        "Why am I wasting my time in some snobby office helping old men get a date?",
        "Is that what I busted my butt in college and graduated early for?",
        "Like, it don't make sense.",
        "Babe, it'll get there.",
        "But, baby, I really feel like I'm getting stuck.",
        "You know what I had to do today?",
        "I just spent three hours with some cheesy computer guy named Harley something.",
        "The Class-Meet guy?",
        "Was he looking for a date?",
        "No. Does everyone know about this guy except for me?",
        "Baby, you should.",
        "He's loaded.",
        "Wow.",
        "You sound like Ava.",
        "Man.",
        "I have to get outta there and start my own practice.",
        "Babe, that's a long ways off.",
        "I figure in about 10 to 15 years we'll be established enough to take that chance.",
        "But right now you don't need to be thinking about that.",
        "10 to 15 years?",
        "Great, that's encouraging.",
        "Thanks, baby.",
        "And my mother called me today.",
        "And she's coming into town for some revival or something.",
        "Which is just what I need.",
        "The stress of this job and the judgment of my mother.",
        "You know she's gonna be bothering me about you, asking me,",
        "\"Judith Ann, have you been doing your wifely duties?\"",
        "Yes, Mother, I have been cooking for him,",
        "I have been cleaning, and I have been having sex with him three times a week, just like it says in the Bible.",
        "It says three times a week, baby?",
        "Then you've been slacking.",
        "Shut up.",
        "I'm kidding.",
        "I'm not.",
        "And...",
        "You know that little thing you do on birthdays and holidays?",
        "I wonder what your mother would say about that.",
        "My mother doesn't know about that little trick",
        "I give you on birthdays and holidays.",
        "And if she did, you wouldn't get it anymore.",
        "I'm gonna get up.",
        "I'm gonna go make you some dinner.",
        "No. You know what I'm gonna do for you?",
        "I'm gonna take you out to dinner.",
        "That $1.99 buffet again, baby?",
        "Made my stomach hurt.",
        "No, I'm gonna take you somewhere nice and fancy.",
        "- Really?",
        "- Yeah, come on, let's go.",
        "Okay, I'm gonna go put my shoes back on.",
        "I'm gonna take you to the $5.99 buffet.",
        "All right, you!",
        "All right.",
        "- I did.",
        "- Good.",
        "And maybe next time we go, the lady next to us...",
        "I was watching and she had the artichoke dip.",
        "- I wanna order that next time.",
        "- I saw it.",
        "- It did look good.",
        "- With the chips.",
        "With the different color chips.",
        "That looked so good.",
        "- Now that.",
        "- With the enchiladas, too.",
        "That's a fine ass bitch right there.",
        "- Was he talking to me?",
        "- Babe, keep walking.",
        "I know you ain't talkin' to me.",
        "- Show some respect.",
        "Kick your ass to hell.",
        "- Baby, come on!",
        "- You know what?",
        "You need to be in church!",
        "- Damn it, get in the car, Judith!",
        "Pick up the Bible since you ain't got no good tact!",
        "- Judith, get in the car.",
        "- Your mama shoulda taught...",
        "Why would you let these assholes ruin our night?",
        "Ain't got no kind of manners.",
        "What the hell they talkin' to me like that for?",
        "This is crazy.",
        "Thinking I'm just some regular bitch on the street.",
        "Enough, Judith.",
        "- Think they can talk to me like that?",
        "- Enough!",
        "Let it go.",
        "I showed 'em!",
        "Just let it go. it doesn't matter.",
        "Their mama shoulda taught them better.",
        "She shoulda had them in school.",
        "- Judith.",
        "Judith!",
        "- Not hanging on the street.",
        "Common whore!",
        "- You stupid joker!",
        "- Judith!",
        "Baby, you been really quiet since dinner.",
        "Did I miss something?",
        "You didn't hear that guy?",
        "Babe, I knew that was it.",
        "Yes, I heard him.",
        "Some things you just gotta ignore.",
        "Why can't I ignore the fact that I didn't feel safe?",
        "Babe, those guys coulda had guns.",
        "We did the right thing.",
        "I just don't like the way I feel.",
        "Baby, I will always protect you.",
        "I'd die for you.",
        "I just wanna go to sleep.",

        "If you say \"go,\" I go.",
        "You!",
        "Stop it.",
        "- No, I'm being serious.",
        "- You are the worst.",
        "No, come on.",
        "Judith, Harley and I have been going over the questionnaire you came up with and he has some questions for you.",
        "You will be putting in some late hours trying to help him.",
        "You don't mind, do you, mon cheri?",
        "All right.",
        "I will be in my office, darling.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay.",
        "So you have some questions?",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes.",
        "Now, this is actually really good.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I need to formulate a program that's gonna tell me what kinda person we're dealing with just based on your questions.",
        "That's a program I'd like to see.",
        "Well, good, because I need you to help me build it.",
        "I'm not a programmer.",
        "Well, that's fine.",
        "I just need your expertise on humans.",
        "All of these questions here.",
        "Now, they tell you a little something about the prospective client, right?",
        "Yes.",
        "As well as the people they will attract.",
        "Okay, great.",
        "What I don't understand is why are there so many questions here about past relationships.",
        "Because you learn a lot about someone from their prior relationships.",
        "You learn patterns.",
        "You learn behaviors.",
        "You learn whether or not they play the victim role.",
        "Do they take full responsibility for their role in the breakup?",
        "All that from one little sheet of paper?",
        "Yes.",
        "\"Hmm\" what?",
        "I've never wanted to know the past of any woman I was ever dating.",
        "Maybe that's why you're single.",
        "Okay.",
        "Last night, I went ahead and filled out one of these.",
        "Maybe you can tell me a little something about myself.",
        "Why would you fill this out?",
        "You're not trying to find a date.",
        "I'd like to see how good you are.",
        "Okay.",
        "Well, you are relationship-oriented.",
        "You give a lot in relationships.",
        "You believe in love, but because you've been hurt a few times, you've given up on it.",
        "You are passionate.",
        "You look like you got a little bit of a mean streak, though.",
        "Very attentive.",
        "Need a lot of reassurance.",
        "Very observant.",
        "Not bad.",
        "Not bad.",
        "So let's continue.",
        "Page two is really interesting.",
        "You need a ride?",
        "No, I'm good.",
        "Can you pass me my purse underneath there?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Thank you, guys.",
        "Good night.",
        "Good night.",
        "Something's wrong with the girl.",
        "What do you mean?",
        "Did you see the way she covered herself up as she's leaving?",
        "It's chilly.",
        "No, something's wrong with the girl.",
        "What, you don't think we made the right decision?",
        "I need the help.",
        "But she has to be watched.",
        "Why don't you just take the whole bucket?",
        "I don't want the whole bucket.",
        "Yes!",
        "Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Judith, you nailed another one.",
        "I did, didn't I?",
        "All right, come on, let's wrap this up.",
        "I gotta get home.",
        "Okay- 50-50 chance that couple's gonna work.",
        "-50-50?",
        "- Yeah.",
        "Training this computer to think like you.",
        "50-50. 50-50.",
        "Let's go.",
        "Come on.",
        "50-50.",
        "Can I get some?",
        "Wow.",
        "Okay.",
        "I'm impressed.",
        "I'm thoroughly impressed.",
        "My husband's never gonna believe that I'm helping out with stuff like this.",
        "You were amazing.",
        "How long you guys been married?",
        "Six years.",
        "I've known him for 19.",
        "19 years?",
        "Wait, so you're a very old-looking young woman or you met him when you were five?",
        "Six.",
        "- Wow.",
        "- Yeah.",
        "So you're 25.",
        "26.",
        "In three days.",
        "Happy early birthday.",
        "I never thought I would be one of those people that dread birthdays, but it just feels like it's a reminder that I'm not where I want to be.",
        "Where did you want to be?",
        "I thought by now, I'd at least have my license.",
        "I'd be a marriage counselor.",
        "I'd be on my way to starting my practice.",
        "You know...",
        "That's very noble, I think.",
        "Marriage counselor, that's a wonderful career.",
        "You should totally do that.",
        "You're super smart.",
        "Look at what we just did.",
        "Judith...",
        "I mean, you're bright.",
        "You're intelligent.",
        "You're motivated.",
        "Set up a business plan and make it happen.",
        "Now.",
        "Did I say something wrong?",
        "No, it's actually very encouraging.",
        "And you know I could totally help you with this marriage counselor thing.",
        "I mean, I have a successful business.",
        "You can ask me anything.",
        "What did you do different than the rest of us?",
        "Like, how'd you become so successful so young?",
        "I've always been ambitious.",
        "Very much a workaholic.",
        "So...",
        "What does that feel like?",
        "Lonely.",
        "It's kinda sad to be able to buy whatever you want and have to beg for what you need.",
        "My last relationship was back in college.",
        "I had met a wonderful woman.",
        "Completely blew my mind and I fell in love with her.",
        "And she walked out on me",
        "and I haven't really been able to rebound. Since then.",
        "Since college, huh?",
        "That's a long time.",
        "I didn't even know she was unhappy.",
        "Are you happy?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, very happy-",
        "He's a great guy.",
        "Good for you.",
        "Especially good for him.",
        "He's a very lucky man, Judith.",
        "It's getting late.",
        "Let's finish it tomorrow.",
        "There was something I wanted to bring up to you about the questionnaire.",
        "Yeah?",
        "I saw the questions about the relationships, compatibility, the hobbies, but there are no questions there about sex.",
        "No,no,no.",
        "I don't believe in sex before marriage, so why would we need that?",
        "Really?",
        "Yes.",
        "Wait a second.",
        "Where are you from?",
        "It's not about where I'm from.",
        "It's called I'm a Christian.",
        "I was raised that way.",
        "So what you're saying is your husband is the only guy you've ever been with.",
        "Ever.",
        "- Yes.",
        "- One guy.",
        "Yes, and my husband and I are very compatible.",
        "How would you know how sexually compatible you are when you have nothing to compare it to?",
        "I watch HBO.",
        "I know I'm not missing anything.",
        "I just keep picturing this same old, boring, turn the lamp off, fluff the pillows, always in the bedroom kinda thing.",
        "What's wrong with the bedroom?",
        "That's unfortunate.",
        "If you were with another man, you'd know that sex should be random.",
        "Like animals.",
        "When it happens, it just happens.",
        "In the kitchen.",
        "In the shower.",
        "In the office.",
        "On a plane.",
        "On the floor.",
        "Are you getting turned on?",
        "Please.",
        "You need to go home.",
        "Hey, babe.",
        "I made you a sandwich.",
        "What's wrong?",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay.",

        "I'm gonna forget you did this, okay?",
        "Now, if you wanna growl at something, you can growl at this sandwich.",
        "After we finish eating, we can go in the bedroom and do this the right way.",
        "Okay?",
        "Can I eat?",
        "Thank you.",
        "We could fluff the pillows, turn off the lamps.",
        "You know, do it the way we always do.",
        "It's going to be a great day if you're planning on being outdoors.",
        "So if you don't have to be at work, or even if you do, make sure you get outside and enjoy the warm weather.",
        "As we are experiencing some really nice above seasonal weather.",
        "You can expect sunny highs in the mid-70s and it could reach even as high as 78.",

        "You know, it's actually feeling better.",
        "Well, it's not swelling.",
        "That's a good thing.",
        "I have to just walk it off.",
        "No, let me see.",
        "Just let me see it.",
        "Hold on.",
        "I don't know if I need all of that.",
        "Just hold on one quick second.",
        "Well, you're pretty good at it.",
        "Yeah, it's just a little something I picked up in college.",
        "- Oh, yeah?",
        "- Yeah.",
        "So was my husband.",
        "Has a bunch of basketball injuries.",
        "Really?",
        "You talk about him a lot.",
        "It's kinda what you do when you're married.",
        "When he comes up, it's kinda in comparison to me.",
        "No, it's not.",
        "Yeah, it actually is.",
        "You wouldn't be comparing us, would you?",
        "Why would I do that?",
        "Well, you tell me.",
        "Okay, my husband is not up for discussion.",
        "- Well, you bring him up a lot.",
        "- No, I do not.",
        "Okay.",
        "I'm sorry.",
        "I shouldn't have said anything about...",
        "Look, it's just that, on one hand, I really wonder who this guy is.",
        "And how special he must be to have gotten you.",
        "And on the other hand, I wonder, does he even know it.",
        "I wonder if he challenges you mentally.",
        "Does he bring out the best in you?",
        "Does he even notice you anymore?",
        "- You know what?",
        "I'm not...",
        "- Judith, listen.",
        "Just listen.",
        "If I had a woman as beautiful as you,",
        "I wouldn't miss a thing.",
        "Like the small blonde hairs on the back of your neck.",
        "Or how your left temple throbs when you're in deep thought.",
        "How calm you get when you're really excited.",
        "Like right now.",
        "That is very sexy.",
        "How slow you're breathing.",
        "Well, I don't miss anything either.",
        "Like the smell of jasmine perfume on this sofa that's obviously fresh.",
        "Or those pair of high heels in your bedroom.",
        "Those diamond earrings on this coffee table.",
        "Don't play with me, Harley.",
        "Verbal sparring.",
        "You know that's a sign I'm winning.",
        "Winning what?",
        "That must be Brice at the door.",
        "- Brice?",
        "Your husband?",
        "- Yeah.",
        "I can't wait to meet this guy.",
        "- Here, let me help.",
        "- I can walk by myself.",
        "I'm gonna help you, okay?",
        "Here we go.",
        "- See, I'm good.",
        "- All right.",
        "It's fine.",
        "Okay?",
        "Hey, be careful.",
        "- Hey!",
        "You must be Brice, right?",
        "- Yeah.",
        "Harley.",
        "Nice to meet you, man.",
        "Hey, babe, what happened?",
        "I fell down when I was running.",
        "Harley helped me out, though.",
        "- Thank you.",
        "- No problem.",
        "Thanks a lot, Harley, I'll see you later.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Nice to meet you.",
        "Likewise.",
        "Thanks again.",
        "It's, you know, it's just...",
        "- Good morning.",
        "- Morning.",
        "Babe, I was thinking.",
        "Were you and Harley running together?",
        "No, he just happened to be in the park.",
        "Okay.",
        "You look nice.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I'll be late tonight.",
        "It's that mid-month inventory.",
        "I hate the 15th.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Your breakfast is on the table.",
        "All right.",
        "Do I have any calls?",
        "Flowers!",
        "Susan, do I have any messages?",
        "I didn't know the 15th was your birthday.",
        "Happy birthday.",
        "Here you go.",
        "Hey, he remembered!",
        "I left the apartment this morning so mad.",
        "I thought my husband forgot my birthday.",
        "But he didn't!",
        "You are so excited about him.",
        "That is great.",
        "Did you try something new?",
        "With your hair?",
        "I sure did!",
        "I curled it.",
        "And you see that green comb?",
        "Right there in my hair?",
        "Unfortunately, I do.",
        "Is your fashion icon a Delta stewardess?",
        "That's what you look like.",
        "Oh, Ava.",
        "- Is this wool?",
        "- Yes.",
        "-It's making me itch.",
        "-It's a blend.",
        "A blend of what?",
        "Ava, can you just give me a break?",
        "It's my birthday.",
        "I tried to do something pretty with my hair.",
        "I have these beautiful flowers from my husband.",
        "I'm smiling.",
        "- Just give me a compliment or something.",
        "- That was a compliment.",
        "He's on his way up.",
        "Come on, we gotta go.",
        "- Who?",
        "My husband?",
        "- No, Harley.",
        "Come on, we really gotta fix this.",
        "- Is that spit?",
        "- Watch my manicure!",
        "- Why are you putting spit in my hair?",
        "- I'm trying to be your friend here, Judith.",
        "When people look at you it reflects bad on me.",
        "They don't think you have a mirror or a friend.",
        "And they know we're friends.",
        "My friends don't look like this.",
        "They look like this.",
        "Ava, I think I look really pretty today.",
        "I tried.",
        "I put on a little extra makeup.",
        "That's not makeup.",
        "That's make down.",
        "I'm matching today, too.",
        "You know, you told me about that.",
        "So you see this gold belt?",
        "The gold belt goes with the gold flappy things on my shoes.",
        "And the blue shoes go with the blue dress.",
        "Oh, my God!",
        "What?",
        "You're wearing flats?",
        "My foot's all...",
        "It hurts a little bit.",
        "Push me out of the window, why don't you?",
        "I would love to.",
        "Harley's here.",
        "Come on, we gotta go.",
        "Enough with the coffee.",
        "No coffee breath.",
        "Come on.",

        "Don't look so disappointed.",
        "No, it's just... lt just said \"Happy birthday, Judith.\"",
        "It didn't say who it was from.",
        "No, I wanted to tell you in person.",
        "I was gonna deliver them myself when I came up, but I just didn't really think that was a good idea.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Smart man.",
        "Yes.",
        "Okay.",
        "Come here for a second.",
        "Let's sit down.",
        "- Have a seat.",
        "- All right.",
        "Harley, I'm gonna be as honest as I can be.",
        "What's going on?",
        "You have plenty of programmers, plenty of employees that could come and help me with this project.",
        "And yet you're coming here every day.",
        "Why?",
        "Judith, I find you extremely beautiful, okay?",
        "And interesting.",
        "And if I have to come here myself to be around you, I will.",
        "I just wanna be involved with you.",
        "Intimately.",
        "And as long as you know that I'm very married...",
        "Point taken.",
        "He loves you.",
        "I saw that when he picked you up.",
        "He's kinda regular.",
        "But lucky.",
        "You just don't impress me as the type of person that would be satisfied with a man like that.",
        "Maybe at one point in time, in your life.",
        "But where you're going,",
        "I just don't see that lasting.",
        "You don't know him.",

        "Don't compromise yourself.",
        "But just flirt.",
        "I understand.",
        "I know I don't know you very well, but I want you to know exactly what you're getting yourself into.",
        "This is a big deal for me and this place.",
        "And I want it in the worst way.",
        "That being said,",
        "I will tell you like I tell all my girls who go out with my guys.",
        "Be nice.",
        "Be aware.",
        "Have fun.",
        "But most of all, be careful.",

        "Hormone injections once a week, that's the first thing.",
        "It's a tricky balancing act, we'll have to monitor your levels until we find the right mix.",

        "We were planning on getting pregnant before the diagnosis.",
        "At this particular time, it would be an extremely high-risk pregnancy, both for you and the baby.",

        "Oh, okay... well we can call in later to reschedule, we'll talk.",
        "No, no, no... fine, we'll uh... we'll use the card.",

        "It's company policy, sir...",
        "I get that it's company policy but that's got nothing to do...",
        "I'm sorry, there's nothing more we can do for you at this point.",
        "So what you're saying is go fuck yourself, have a nice day.",
        "I sincerely doubt you're at all apologetic.",

        "Jim, I read the invoice and hormone treatments, they cost $300 a shot.",
        "That's on top of all the other medication and then the gene therapy, they could be anywhere from",
        "50,000 to 70,000, and if the insurance doesn't cover it...",
        "I'm not, I can't let you spend our whole life savings.",
        "Stop, stop!",
        "Stop.",
        "Listen to me, we need the treatments, you need to get well.",

        "Dude, that sucks!",
        "There's an actual coverage cap on the insurance, that means that there's really literally like, a limit to how much you can spend on Rosie per month for her medical?",
        "it says if you get too sick and it's too expensive, they stop fucking paying.",
        "I was planning on having by the time I was 60.",
        "I guess if I get sick I'd be better off swallowing my own gun.",
        "Rosie's worried out of her fucking mind.",
        "So what are you gonna do?",
        "I got some money tucked away, army disability, stuff like that.",

        "Fuck.",
        "I'm not making enough.",

        "Look Jim, I'm not dealing with your investment.",
        "It looks like there has been a crime, and the DA's office is dealing with that.",
        "Now if this is true, I'd be happy to assist you if you decide to sue for damages.",
        "But we have to start by filing this complaint for injunctive relief to protect you from the 60,000 demand and the interest it's going to accumulate.",

        "Yeah, my folks lost their nest egg.",
        "I'm fucked.",

        "What do you fucking think?",
        "You got family you could borrow from?",
        "Not an option.",
        "but I could scratch up a few bucks.",
        "Yeah, we could take up a collection with the guys.",
        "Guys, guys...",

        "It's for you, sweetie.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Later.",
        "Jim...",
        "I got uh... 10 grand I can loan you.",
        "Please Jim, listen to me man.",
        "Sean, forget about it.",
        "Look, I don't have a girlfriend, I don't have a family,",
        "I don't have anything...",
        "okay?",
        "Please, let me help you out, it would mean a lot to me.",
        "I might take you up on that, pay this lawyer.",
        "Just hang in there.",
        "It's called an adjustable rate for a reason, when the housing market changes... so do the interest rates, that's how that works.",

        "I'm not gonna be able to keep up at this rate.",
        "Yeah, you got a favourable deal when you signed.",
        "The terms of which was that a specified point in time the interest rate would reflect the market.",
        "Can we refinance?",
        "Well your net worth has taken a significant hit over the last few days and your wife, she hasn't worked for a year or so, right?",
        "Yeah, she got sick.",
        "But in light of all of that, refinancing wouldn't be prudent for our bank at this time.",
        "So you're shafting me?",
        "No, no... it's not me, it's the guidelines handed down from above.",
        "If it were up to me, I would help you out.",
        "Uh, you could always try to sell your house.",
        "I can't sell my house is this market.",
        "I'm sorry, I don't know what else to tell you.",
        "You could declare bankruptcy, a lot of people do that.",
        "Fuck you.",
        "That's a fair response, I suppose.",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey.",
        "You at the bank?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well what was it about?",
        "Like I said, don't worry about it.",
        "All right?",
        "Mmmhmm.",
        "Good.",
        "Ahh...",
        "I knew you'd have no problems coming up with this.",
        "I got it from a friend.",
        "It will and then I'll see if I can find other investors who got burned on this and put together a collective lawsuit.",
        "Collective ball scratching.",
        "What's that?",
        "It's just a joke.",
        "Not funny, I guess.",
        "Don't underestimate the power of a large group when it comes to asking for damages.",
        "I hope so.",
        "So what do I do about this letter demanding 60 grand?",
        "I'll contact the other party,",
        "I will let them know I am your attorney and that you will not be paying.",
        "You know, there may be another way out of this.",
        "You take the fall on this but it could end all this drama for you instantly.",
        "Would you be willing to write off your initial investment and walk away if these guys let you out of the 60,000?",
        "It's something you should consider.",
        "It could be years before the real estate market bounces back.",
        "If for some reason I can get the court to grant injunctive relief to stop these guys, years of interest on this claim against you.",
        "This motion, it's gonna work right?",
        "Most likely, but nothing in law is for certain.",
        "I'm just offering this as an option but if they're willing to let you play ball and back off, then you can put it all behind you.",
        "It'd be nice, huh?",
        "Okay, don't think about it for too long, the time to act is now.",
        "You just paid me, I can either file the complaint as planned or I can try and negotiate directly with them but I need to do one or the other.",
        "I need a day.",
        "Half a day would be better.",
        "All right, I uh...",
        "I got a meeting with the assistant district attorney today.",
        "Oh yeah, good.",
        "I'll put that in the letter.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Let me know what happens.",
        "I'm sure I double checked the schedule when you called doesn't have time in his schedule for you today.",
        "I'm sorry, I can leave him a message if you'd like.",
        "Well um, maybe you can answer a few questions for me.",
        "I'm afraid that I wouldn't be any help with anything.",
        "I'm not even a legal secretary, I'm just an assistant.",
        "Just the assistant, that's your excuse?",
        "Do you have any idea what's going on here?",

        "I am security, you fucking bitch.",
        "Get your fucking hands off me.",
        "So... how did it go today?",
        "The bastard didn't have time for me.",

        "100 cents on the dollar and all those... were also secretary of the treasury.",

        "There you go.",
        "Go on. Have away.",
        "Seriously, I really need to tell you about this new land we came across.",
        "Another one?",
        "Any new dragons?",
        "We didn't stick around to find out.",
        "These folks weren't particularly friendly.",
        "Really? Your Night Fury and Deadly Nadder didn't bring them cheering to the rooftops?",
        "No, this was different.",
        "Not the standard run-for-the-hills hoo-ha I've come to enjoy.",
        "These guys were trappers.",
        "Dragon trappers.",
        "You should have seen their fort.",
        "All blown apart and stuck in giant spikes of ice.",
        "It was weird!",
        "I've never seen anything like it.",
        "And worst of all, they thought we did it!",
        "You two are gonna get yourselves in serious trouble one of these days.",
        "Not everyone appreciates this way of life.",
        "Aye, Gobber's right, son.",
        "Best we keep to our own.",
        "Besides, you'll have more important uses for your time.",
        "Once we make the big announcement!",
        "They are building a dragon army.",
        "Or at least the guy they work for is.",
        "Dargo Bloody Fist, or something.",
        "I'll bloody his fist with my face if he tries to take my dragon!",
        "Or mine!",
        "You're such a moron.",
        "A beautiful moron.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Bludvist?",
        "Drago Bludvist?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Wait.",
        "You know him?",
        "Ground all dragons!",
        "What?",
        "Why? Seal the gates!",
        "Lower the storm doors!",
        "Wait!",
        "What is happening?",
        "Come on!",
        "You heard the man! Lock it down.",
        "No dragon or Viking sets foot off this island until I give the word!",
        "Wait, because some guy you knew is stirring up trouble... in some faraway land?",
        "Because Drago Bludvist is a madman... without conscience or mercy.",
        "And if he's built a dragon army, gods help us all.",
        "Get them into their pens!",
        "Quickly!",
        "Then, let's ride back out there.",
        "We'll follow those trappers to Drago and talk some sense into him.",
        "No.",
        "We fortify the island.",
        "It's our duty to keep the peace!",
        "Peace is over, Hiccup.",
        "I must prepare you for war.",
        "War?",
        "Dad, if Drago is coming for our dragons... we can't wait around for him to get here.",
        "Let's go find him and change his mind.",
        "No, some minds won't be changed, Hiccup.",
        "Berk is what you need to worry about.",
        "A chief protects his own.",
        "Secure the stables!",
        "Latch every stall!",
        "Hiccup, don't!",
        "I have to.",
        "This way!",
        "Quickly!",
        "Hiccup!",
        "Come on!",
        "Hiccup!",
        "Keep your eyes peeled, lads!",
        "With this wind, we'll reach Drago by daybreak... so best we fill this ship up with dragons, and quick!",
        "It's no time to be picky.",
        "Eret?",
        "Not if we want to keep our heads!",
        "Off the port quarter!",
        "Net them, lads!",
        "Take them down!",
        "You're not getting away this time.",
        "Fire!",
        "Reload!",
        "Reload!",
        "Incoming!",
        "And here I was... worried we might turn up empty-handed.",
        "Nope.",
        "It's your lucky day.",
        "We give up.",
        "That's one Night Fury, one Deadly Nadder... and two of the finest dragon riders west of Luk Tuk.",
        "That ought to make the boss happy, right?",
        "Excuse us.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Toothless, stay.",
        "The dragons don't care for cramped spaces, so they'll just hang out with you.",
        "They won't be any trouble.",
        "Unless you do that.",
        "You know, wooden boat, big ocean.",
        "How is your swimming?",
        "Not good.",
        "Oops! Almost forgot.",
        "You can't have armed prisoners.",
        "How is this a plan?",
        "Just what every dragon trapper needs.",
        "One end coats the blade in Monstrous Nightmare saliva.",
        "The other sprays Hideous Zippleback gas.",
        "All it takes is a spark, and...",
        "Yeah, there you go.",
        "Once they see you as one of their own... even the testiest dragons can be trained.",
        "Right, bud?",
        "Give me that!",
        "What game are you playing?",
        "No game.",
        "We just wanna meet Drago.",
        "Why?",
        "Because I'm going to change his mind about dragons.",
        "He can be really persuasive.",
        "Once you've earned his loyalty... there is nothing a dragon won't do for you.",
        "You won't be changing any minds around here.",
        "I can change yours.",
        "Right here.",
        "Right now.",
        "May I?",
        "Dragon riders!",
        "Put me down!",
        "Snotlout, what are you doing?",
        "See how well I protect and provide?",
        "That was... close.",
        "Hey, watch it!",
        "My.",
        "Me likey.",
        "Take me.",
        "Hold your fire!",
        "What are you guys doing here?",
        "We're here to rescue you!",
        "I don't need to be rescued!",
        "Enough!",
        "Well, didn't you just pick the wrong ship?",
        "I am Eret, son of Eret.",
        "Get this thing off me.",
        "Anyone else?",
        "That's what I figured.",
        "You, saddle up.",
        "We're going home.",
        "No.",
        "Of all the irresponsible...",
        "I'm trying to protect our dragons and stop a war!",
        "How is that irresponsible?",
        "Because war is what he wants, son!",
        "Years ago, there was a great gathering of chieftains... to discuss the dragon scourge we all faced.",
        "Into our midst came a stranger from a strange land... covered in scars and draped in a cloak of dragon skin.",
        "He carried no weapon... and spoke softly, saying that he...",
        "Drago Bludvist, was a man of the people... devoted to freeing mankind from the tyranny of dragons.",
        "He claimed that he alone could control the dragons... and that he alone could keep us safe... if we chose to bow down... and follow him.",
        "Stupid.",
        "Good one.",
        "Aye, we laughed, too.",
        "Until he wrapped himself in his cloak and cried out...",
        "\"Then see how well you do without me!\"",
        "The rooftop suddenly burst into flames... and from it, armored dragons descended... burning the hall to the ground.",
        "I... was the only one to escape.",
        "Men who kill without reason cannot be reasoned with.",
        "Maybe.",
        "Hiccup!",
        "I'm still going to try.",
        "This is what I'm good at.",
        "And if I could change your mind...",
        "I can change his, too.",
        "Come on.",
        "- Let's go.",
        "- No! Lead the others back to Berk.",
        "I've had enough mutiny for one day.",
        "I like that.",
        "Ruffnut!",
        "Okay!",
        "Don't worry, bud.",
        "I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.",
        "I promise.",
        "Come on, Dad!",
        "Really?",
        "Okay.",
        "No sudden moves.",
        "Hold on.",
        "Hold on.",
        "Toothless!",
        "Hey! You left my dragon back there!",
        "He can't fly on his own!",
        "He will drown!",
        "Hey!",
        "We have to head back for my dragon!",
        "Who are you?",
        "The dragon thief?",
        "Drago Bludvist?",
        "Do you even understand what I'm saying?",
        "Toothless!",
        "It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.",
        "I'm glad to see you, too, bud.",
        "You really had me worried, there.",
        "Hiccup?",
        "Could it be?",
        "After all these years?",
        "How is this possible?",
        "Should I know you?",
        "No, you were only a babe.",
        "But a mother never forgets.",
        "Come.",
        "Boar-headed!",
        "Just like his mother!",
        "Aye, she could never stay put either.",
        "He's just twenty.",
        "And a Viking.",
        "Could there be a worse combination?",
        "When I think of how stubborn and senseless you were back in the day...",
        "Well, not much has changed, actually.",
        "You know what he's like.",
        "He won't give up, Gobber.",
        "And if Hiccup finds Drago, before we find him...",
        "Nothing can hurt Hiccup... so long as that Night Fury's around.",
        "It's a Night Fury!",
        "Find them, Skullcrusher.",
        "Find them.",
        "Hold on.",
        "Wait just a minute.",
        "This way!",
        "Come back here!",
        "Come.",
        "You can't just say something like that and run off!",
        "You're my mother?",
        "I mean, what the...",
        "Do you grasp how insane it sounds?",
        "Come, quickly!",
        "I have questions!",
        "Where have you been all this time?",
        "What have you been doing?",
        "But they said you were dead!",
        "Everyone thinks you were eaten by...",
        "This is where you've been for 20 years?",
        "You've been rescuing them.",
        "Unbelievable.",
        "You're not upset?",
        "What?",
        "No.",
        "I don't know.",
        "It's a bit much to get my head around, to be frank.",
        "It's not every day you find out... your mother is some kind of crazy, feral, vigilante dragon lady.",
        "At least I'm not boring, right?",
        "I suppose there is that one specific thing.",
        "Do you like it?",
        "I don't have the words.",
        "Can I...",
        "He's beautiful.",
        "Incredible!",
        "He might very well be the last of his kind.",
        "And look, he's your age.",
        "Wow.",
        "No wonder you get along so well.",
        "And retractable teeth!",
        "How did you manage to...",
        "I found him in the woods.",
        "He was shot down and wounded.",
        "This Snafflefang lost his leg to one of Drago Bludvist's iron traps.",
        "This Raincutter had her wing sliced by razor netting.",
        "And this poor Hobblegrunt... was blinded by a tree snare... and then left to die alone and scared.",
        "And what of this?",
        "Did Drago or his trappers do this, too?",
        "Yeah...",
        "The crazy thing is...",
        "I'm actually the one who shot him down.",
        "Hey, it's okay, though.",
        "He got me back!",
        "Right, bud?",
        "You couldn't save all of me, could you?",
        "You just had to make it even.",
        "So, peg leg!",
        "What did your father think of your Night Fury friend?",
        "He didn't take it all that well.",
        "But then he changed.",
        "They all did.",
        "Pretty soon, everyone back home had dragons of their own.",
        "If only it were possible.",
        "No, really.",
        "Believe me, I tried, as well... but people are not capable of change, Hiccup.",
        "Some of us were just born different.",
        "Hoist the torches!",
        "Berk was a land of \"kill-or-be-killed\"... but I believed peace was possible.",
        "Stop!",
        "You'll only make it worse!",
        "It was a very unpopular opinion.",
        "Hiccup!",
        "Then, one night, a dragon broke into our house... finding you in the cradle.",
        "I rushed to protect you.",
        "But what I saw... was proof of everything I believed.",
        "This wasn't a vicious beast... but an intelligent, gentle creature... whose soul... reflected my own.",
        "Valka, run!",
        "No!",
        "Don't!",
        "Hold on!",
        "No!",
        "Stoick!",
        "Valka!",
        "Stoick!",
        "Valka.",
        "You and your father nearly died that night... all because I couldn't kill a dragon.",
        "It runs in the family.",
        "It broke my heart to stay away... but I believed you would be safer if I did.",
        "How did you survive?",
        "Cloudjumper never meant to harm me.",
        "He must have thought I belonged here.",
        "In the home of the great Bewilderbeast.",
        "The alpha species.",
        "One of the very few that still exist.",
        "Every nest has its queen... but this is the king of all dragons.",
        "With his icy breath, this graceful giant built our nest.",
        "A safe haven for dragons everywhere.",
        "Wait, that's the ice-spitter?",
        "He's responsible for all that destruction?",
        "He protects us.",
        "We all live under his care and his command.",
        "All but the babies, of course who listen to no one!",
        "I've lived among them... for 20 years, Hiccup... discovering their secrets.",
        "He likes you.",
        "You must be hungry.",
        "Yeah, I could eat.",
        "Good.",
        "It's feeding time.",
        "I don't like it.",
        "They should have been back with Hiccup by now.",
        "I don't like it either.",
        "Eret, son of Eret... was the man of my dreams.",
        "My everything!",
        "But, baby, I grew facial hair for you.",
        "Me, too.",
        "What if Drago shot them down?",
        "What if they need our help?",
        "We have to find them.",
        "Wait, what?",
        "No, but Stoick said...",
        "It doesn't matter what he said, if they have all been captured.",
        "Come on!",
        "Do we go back?",
        "We have nowhere to go, nothing to sell... and no heads to call our own!",
        "If we don't turn up with dragons, and fast...",
        "Careful what you wish for!",
        "Eret, son of Eret!",
        "What is this?",
        "A kidnapping.",
        "- Yay!",
        "Can he ride with me?",
        "- Can he?",
        "You're gonna show us the way to Drago.",
        "And help dragon riders sneak into Drago's camp?",
        "Just kill me now.",
        "That could be arranged.",
        "Stormfly, drop it!",
        "Good girl!",
        "Stormfly, fetch!",
        "All right!",
        "Okay!",
        "I'll take you to Drago!",
        "Works every time.",
        "Hey, I thought we were going to eat.",
        "We are.",
        "Then, from Dragon Island...",
        "I found this archipelago.",
        "There.",
        "When I'm up here...",
        "I don't even feel the cold.",
        "I just feel...",
        "Free.",
        "This is what it is to be a dragon, Hiccup.",
        "It's all well and good to call yourself a dragon... but can you fly?",
        "No!",
        "Man! Almost!",
        "We just about had it that time!",
        "Incredible.",
        "Well, not bad yourself.",
        "All this time, you took after me.",
        "And where was I?",
        "I'm so sorry, Hiccup.",
        "Can we start over?",
        "Will you give me another chance?",
        "I can teach you all that I have learned these past 20 years.",
        "Like...",
        "Wow.",
        "Now you can make those tight turns.",
        "Did you know about this?",
        "Every dragon has its secrets.",
        "And I'll show them all to you.",
        "We'll unlock every mystery... find every last species together... as mother and son.",
        "This gift we share, Hiccup, it bonds us.",
        "This is who you are, son.",
        "Who we are.",
        "We will change the world for all dragons.",
        "We will make it a better, safer place.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That sounds amazing.",
        "This is so great!",
        "Now you and I can go talk to Drago together.",
        "What?",
        "There's no talking to Drago.",
        "But we have to...",
        "No. We must protect our own.",
        "Come on, we should be getting back.",
        "Okay!",
        "Look, I got you here.",
        "Now get this thing off me.",
        "Never take a toy from a dragon.",
        "Don't you know anything?",
        "Why does this keep happening to me?",
        "What's down there?",
        "Large diameter bubbles, massive lungs... cold water deep dweller.",
        "I'm thinking class five leviathan, maybe six.",
        "Meatlug!",
        "What's wrong, girl?",
        "Drago!",
        "Get off me!",
        "Always great to see you, my friend!",
        "Keeping warm up here?",
        "As you can see, I'm right on time with a new batch of dragons... just like I promised.",
        "He's waking up!",
        "Give me some backup, here!",
        "Drop the ropes!",
        "- Hookfang!",
        "- Hey!",
        "What are you doing?",
        "You belong to me now.",
        "And as an added bonus...",
        "I also caught you their riders.",
        "No extra charge.",
        "What?",
        "Are you kidding me?",
        "Aw! But you were so perfect!",
        "Turns out, there is a whole bunch of them out there.",
        "How many?",
        "Drago doesn't have them after all.",
        "- How many?",
        "- Hundreds.",
        "A whole island full!",
        "I wouldn't worry about it.",
        "My men are hunting them down as we speak.",
        "They won't know where you're hiding, I promise you that.",
        "Yes, they will.",
        "They know we're missing... and they have tracking dragons.",
        "If you so much as touch us, Hiccup is gonna kick...",
        "- Hiccup?",
        "- He's not a problem.",
        "Really.",
        "Trust me.",
        "He's only the son of Stoick the Vast, his heir to the throne of Berk... and the greatest dragon master this world has ever seen!",
        "Dragon master?",
        "I alone control the dragons!",
        "No.",
        "Sorry.",
        "And unless you let us go, right now... he will blast through here on his Night Fury... and blow your entire fleet of ships to splinters.",
        "Then they will be crying like babies.",
        "Funny and beautiful.",
        "Good one, babe!",
        "Like babies, they always cry.",
        "Real tiny ones.",
        "First, there was one rider, and now, all of Berk.",
        "And you led them to me!",
        "Drago!",
        "Stop all preparations!",
        "We must attack the dragon riders' nest at once!",
        "We will take down their alpha!",
        "Then we will take Berk!",
        "Drago.",
        "And get rid of him.",
        "Drago, please, I...",
        "Stormfly!",
        "No!",
        "Well, bud, we can't wait around for Drago to attack this place.",
        "We've gotta find him first.",
        "Let's go.",
        "Easy now.",
        "Are you kidding me?",
        "How did you get in here?",
        "The same way we are getting you out.",
        "We?",
        "All clear.",
        "Toothless, come.",
        "Wait.",
        "There's something you need to know.",
        "Yeah, yeah, tell me on the way.",
        "This isn't an on-the-way kind of update, actually.",
        "I've heard enough.",
        "More of the earth-shattering-development variety.",
        "Yeah, just add it to the pile.",
        "Dad, unlike most surprises I spring on you, this is one you'll like.",
        "I promise.",
        "You just have to handle it delicately.",
        "You might want to take this one.",
        "Boy.",
        "Dad... could you put the sword away, please?",
        "I know what you're gonna say, Stoick.",
        "How could I have done this?",
        "Stayed away all of these years?",
        "And why did I not come back to you?",
        "To our son?",
        "What sign did I have that you could change, Stoick?",
        "That anyone on Berk could?",
        "I pleaded so many times to stop the fighting... to find another answer, but did any of you listen?",
        "This is why I never married.",
        "This and one other reason.",
        "I know that I left you to raise Hiccup alone... but I thought he would be better off without me.",
        "And I was wrong, I see that now, but...",
        "Stop being so stoic, Stoick!",
        "Go on.",
        "Shout, scream, say something!",
        "You're as beautiful as the day I lost you.",
        "Could this day get any worse?",
        "Let me see.",
        "We're gonna jump into freezing cold water, and then die from drowning.",
        "Looks refreshing.",
        "Please, ladies first.",
        "You are a steaming heap of dragon...",
        "Duck.",
        "Warn the others!",
        "Get them, you son of an Eret.",
        "Take that!",
        "Okay, I love you again.",
        "Pathetic.",
        "You can still jump.",
        "So, are we going to save your dragons and get out of here, or not?",
        "Check every trap.",
        "They're here somewhere.",
        "Meatlug?",
        "Anyone coming?",
        "I don't know.",
        "You just keep doing what you are doing.",
        "Keep cranking.",
        "Thank you for saving my life.",
        "Now let me return the favor.",
        "Mom, you'd never even recognize it.",
        "Where we used to make weapons, we now build saddles, wing-slings.",
        "We even fix dragon teeth!",
        "You wouldn't believe how much everything's changed.",
        "Our son has changed Berk for the better.",
        "I think we did well with this one, Val.",
        "Thanks, Dad.",
        "I'm a little out of practice.",
        "Well, you know...",
        "- I didn't marry you for your cooking.",
        "- I hope not.",
        "Her meatballs could kill more beasts than a battle-axe.",
        "I've still got a few knocking around in here.",
        "And once you move back in, with all your dragons...",
        "Drago won't even stand a chance.",
        "Everything will be okay!",
        "Slow down, son.",
        "It's a lot to take in.",
        "Gotcha.",
        "I love this one.",
        "Remember our song, Val?",
        "I'll swim and sail on savage seas",
        "With ne'er a fear of drowning",
        "And gladly ride the waves of life",
        "If you will marry me",
        "No scorching sun",
        "Nor freezing cold Will stop...",
        "Will stop me on my journey",
        "Sorry.",
        "If you will promise me your heart",
        "And love...",
        "And love me for eternity",
        "My dearest one",
        "My darling dear",
        "Your mighty words astound me",
        "But I've no need of mighty deeds",
        "When I feel your arms around me",
        "But I would bring you rings of gold",
        "I'd even sing you poetry",
        "Whoo! Would you?",
        "And I would keep you from all harm",
        "If you would stay beside me",
        "I have no use for rings of gold",
        "I care not for your poetry I only want your hand to hold",
        "I only want you near me",
        "To love and kiss, to sweetly hold",
        "For the dancing and the dreaming",
        "Through all life's sorrows and delights I'll keep your love inside me",
        "I will swim and sail on savage seas",
        "With ne'er a fear of drowning",
        "And gladly ride the waves of life",
        "If you will marry me",
        "I'm still going",
        "Gobber!",
        "I'm done.",
        "I thought I would have to die before we could have that dance again.",
        "No need for drastic measures.",
        "For you, my dear... anything.",
        "Will you come home, Val?",
        "Will you be my wife once again?",
        "We can be a family!",
        "What do you say?",
        "Yes.",
        "Great!",
        "I'll do the cooking.",
        "Thank Odin you didn't listen to me, son.",
        "We never would have found each other.",
        "Toothless?",
        "What's happening?",
        "No.",
        "Val?",
        "Val!",
        "It's all right, it's all right.",
        "We're a team now.",
        "What do you want to do?",
        "We have to save the dragons.",
        "Aye.",
        "You got it!",
        "Come on, son.",
        "Whatever comes, keep hitting the mountain.",
        "We need to draw the alpha out.",
        "Ready the traps!",
        "Surprise!",
        "Yeah!",
        "What?",
        "You really are full of surprises!",
        "Let's go!",
        "Dragon riders, coming through!",
        "Fire!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Cut them down!",
        "Eret, son of Eret!",
        "Up, girl!",
        "Lean left, Eret!",
        "That's it!",
        "Look out!",
        "Yeah, baby!",
        "Take them down!",
        "Heads up!",
        "Dragon master.",
        "Welcome aboard, dragon rider!",
        "Thanks, I think.",
        "Where have you been?",
        "You know, catching up with Mom.",
        "That's your mother?",
        "Now you know where I get my dramatic flair.",
        "The alpha!",
        "Now we have a fight!",
        "Come on, Toothless!",
        "Show them what you got, bud.",
        "That a boy!",
        "I've waited a long time for this!",
        "You cannot take our dragons!",
        "They are controlled by the alpha!",
        "Then it's a good thing I brought a challenger.",
        "Another one?",
        "That is a class ten!",
        "Class ten!",
        "No.",
        "Come on! Take down the alpha!",
        "Thank you.",
        "For you, my dear... anything.",
        "Val, do you think you can stop them?",
        "I'll do my best.",
        "Come on, Cloudjumper!",
        "You!",
        "I watched you burn!",
        "It takes more than a little fire to kill me!",
        "Stoick!",
        "No!",
        "No!",
        "We have won.",
        "Now, finish her!",
        "No!",
        "Hold on!",
        "Skullcrusher, go!",
        "Come on, Gobber!",
        "Right behind you, Stoick!",
        "Stop!",
        "Stop!",
        "This is the great dragon master?",
        "The son of Stoick the Vast?",
        "What shame he must feel.",
        "All of this loss, and for what?",
        "To become unstoppable?",
        "To rule the world?",
        "Dragons are kind, amazing creatures... that can bring people together.",
        "Or tear them apart.",
        "You see...",
        "I know what it is to live in fear.",
        "To see my village burned... my family taken.",
        "But even as a boy... left with nothing...",
        "I vowed to rise above the fear of dragons... and liberate the people of this world.",
        "Then why a dragon army?",
        "Well, you need dragons to conquer other dragons.",
        "Or maybe you need dragons to conquer people.",
        "To control those who follow you... and to get rid of those who won't.",
        "Clever boy.",
        "The world wants peace.",
        "And we have the answer back on Berk.",
        "Just let me show you.",
        "No!",
        "Let me show you!",
        "What in...",
        "Hiccup!",
        "Come on, Gobber!",
        "Okay, change of plan!",
        "No dragon can resist the alpha's command.",
        "So, he who controls the alpha... controls them all.",
        "Toothless?",
        "Toothless, you okay, bud?",
        "What's going on?",
        "Witness true strength.",
        "The strength of will over others.",
        "In the face of it... you are nothing.",
        "What did he just tell you?",
        "Toothless, come on.",
        "What's the matter with you?",
        "No, no, no, no.",
        "Come on. What are you doing?",
        "Knock it off.",
        "Stop!",
        "Snap out of it!",
        "Toothless, no!",
        "Toothless!",
        "Don't!",
        "Hiccup!",
        "Stop!",
        "Son!",
        "Dad!",
        "No!",
        "No.",
        "Dad!",
        "Stoick!",
        "Dad.",
        "No, you...",
        "No.",
        "No, no, no.",
        "No!",
        "Get away from him!",
        "Go on!",
        "Get out of here!",
        "Get away!",
        "It's not his fault.",
        "You know that.",
        "Good dragons... under the control of bad people...",
        "Wait!",
        "Don't go.",
        "...do bad things.",
        "Come on!",
        "Gather the men and meet me at Berk!",
        "Toothless!",
        "No, don't.",
        "May the Valkyries welcome you... and lead you through Odin's great battlefield.",
        "May they sing your name with love and fury... so that we might hear it rise from the depths of Valhalla... and know that you have taken your rightful place... at the table of kings.",
        "For a great man has fallen.",
        "A warrior.",
        "A Chieftain.",
        "A father.",
        "A friend.",
        "I'm sorry, Dad.",
        "I'm not the chief that you wanted me to be.",
        "And I'm not the peacekeeper I thought I was.",
        "I don't know...",
        "You came early into this world.",
        "You were such a wee thing.",
        "So frail, so fragile.",
        "I feared you wouldn't make it.",
        "But your father... he never doubted.",
        "He always said you would become the strongest of them all.",
        "And he was right.",
        "You have the heart of a chief and a soul of a dragon.",
        "Only you can bring our worlds together.",
        "That is who you are, son.",
        "I was so afraid of becoming my dad.",
        "Mostly because I thought I never could.",
        "How do you become someone that great?",
        "That brave?",
        "That selfless?",
        "I guess you can only try.",
        "A chief protects his own.",
        "We are going back.",
        "With what?",
        "He took all the dragons.",
        "Not all of them.",
        "I don't want to die!",
        "We can't fly these things!",
        "Yeah, no kidding!",
        "But won't that Bewilderbeast just take control of these guys, too?",
        "They're babies.",
        "They don't listen to anyone.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Just like us!",
        "This is very dangerous!",
        "Some might suggest this is poorly conceived.",
        "It's a good thing that I never listen.",
        "So what is your plan?",
        "Get Toothless back and kick Drago's...",
        "Heads up!",
        "And that thing.",
        "That's a good boy.",
        "Watch the furniture!",
        "Where are you going?",
        "Your chief is dead.",
        "Stoick?",
        "No one can protect you now.",
        "No.",
        "He took all the dragons!",
        "Distract the alpha.",
        "Try to keep his focus off Toothless.",
        "How?",
        "Have you forgotten who you're riding with?",
        "There isn't a dragon alive that I can't wrangle!",
        "Except for this one!",
        "Amateur.",
        "Hey, look.",
        "It's Hiccup!",
        "What?",
        "Keep them coming!",
        "Black sheep, baby!",
        "Ten points!",
        "I'm okay!",
        "You certainly are hard to get rid of, I'll say that.",
        "Toothless?",
        "Hey... it's me, bud.",
        "It's me.",
        "It's me.",
        "I'm right here, bud.",
        "Come back to me.",
        "He's not yours anymore.",
        "He belongs to the alpha.",
        "But, please, great dragon master... try to take him.",
        "He will not miss a second time.",
        "It wasn't your fault, bud.",
        "They made you do it.",
        "You would never hurt him.",
        "You would never hurt me.",
        "How are you doing that?",
        "Please.",
        "You are my best friend, bud.",
        "My best friend.",
        "Atta boy!",
        "That's it!",
        "I'm here!",
        "Enough!",
        "Hang on!",
        "Almost there, buddy.",
        "Do something!",
        "We need to get those two apart.",
        "We have to block him out, Toothless.",
        "Do you trust me, bud?",
        "We can do this.",
        "You and me.",
        "As one.",
        "That's it.",
        "Now let's try this one more time!",
        "Take him down, babe!",
        "Go get them!",
        "Take control of it!",
        "Shut it out, Toothless.",
        "Stop them!",
        "Not again.",
        "Toothless!",
        "It's now or never!",
        "Come on, bud!",
        "Hold on!",
        "Yeah!",
        "We did it!",
        "Hold him there, Toothless.",
        "It's all over now.",
        "Or is it?",
        "No!",
        "No!",
        "No!",
        "Hiccup!",
        "He's challenging the alpha!",
        "To protect you.",
        "No, no, no!",
        "Fight back!",
        "Fight!",
        "Fight!",
        "What's the matter with you?",
        "Now do you get it?",
        "This is what it is to earn a dragon's loyalty.",
        "Let this end.",
        "Now.",
        "Never!",
        "Come on!",
        "Fight!",
        "The alpha protects them all.",
        "You never cease to amaze me, bud.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Toothless, you know that doesn't wash out!",
        "I knew you'd come back!",
        "Stormfly!",
        "Give me a cuddle, Grumpy!",
        "Who's my little princess?",
        "Don't you ever leave again, Hookfang.",
        "You are!",
        "Yes, you are! I missed you!",
        "Barf!",
        "Not you!",
        "That was some pretty fine dragon wrangling back there.",
        "You'd make a good trapper.",
        "Whoa! You know, Skullcrusher's gonna need somebody to look after him now.",
        "Me?",
        "I'd be honored.",
        "Your father would be every bit as proud as I am.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I'm really glad you're here, Mom.",
        "And here I'll stay.",
        "See?",
        "I told you it was in here.",
        "Still doing that one?",

        "And, bit by bit, we will change this world.",
        "You see, we have something they don't.",
        "Sure, they have armies... and they have armadas... but we have... our dragons!",

        "A man once came to our house to kill my father.",
        "He didn't know I was upstairs playing in my bedroom.",
        "Or that Papa kept a Beretta Nine-millimeter under the sink with the bleach.",

        "Evening, sir.",
        "Using the Smart Blood, I've tracked Bond to a point here in North Africa.",
        "See, every known map registers it as empty desert.",
        "Exactly.",
        "But if you look at the satellite blowup, you can clearly see this.",
        "We can't help him.",
        "But, sir, we know where he's heading.",
        "C is watching everything we do.",

        "Well, it was that or the priesthood.",
        "I'm serious.",
        "Is this really what you want?",
        "Living in the shadows?",
        "Hunting?",
        "Being hunted?",
        "Always looking behind you?",
        "Always alone?",
        "But I'm not alone.",
        "Answer the question.",

        "Your host invites you both to rest, relax, and join him for drinks at 4:00.",
        "- Tell our host we won't be late.",
        "- Wonderful.",
        "Before we show you to your rooms, just one more thing.",
        "You be careful with that.",

        "- Do you know what it is?",
        "- It's a meteorite.",
        "Yes, exactly.",
        "The Kartenhoff.",
        "The oldest in human possession.",
        "The very meteorite which made this crater.",
        "Think about it.",
        "So many years up there, alone, silent, building momentum until it chose to make its mark on Earth.",
        "A huge, unstoppable force.",
        "Except it did stop, didn't it?",
        "Right here.",
        "I can't tell you how much I've been looking forward to this.",
        "All of us here, together.",
        "A reunion.",
        "I'm so glad you came too, dear Madeleine.",
        "You were just a girl when I saw you first.",

        "- What is this place?",

        "Information is all... is it not?",
        "For example, you must know by now that the double-0 program is officially dead.",
        "Which leads me to speculate exactly why you came.",
        "So, James, why did you come?",
        "I came here to kill you.",
        "And I thought you came here to die.",
        "Well, it's all a matter of perspective.",
        "Speaking of perspective.",
        "- Is this live?",
        "- Live and direct. 16:20 GMT.",
        "What an uncanny coincidence.",
        "The French have a saying, \"It's the fate of glass to break.\"",
        "Well, maybe it's the fate of spies to just disappear.",
        "But with any luck, we leave something behind.",
        "In the meantime, I'm sure C will keep you all busy.",
        "Thank you all.",
        "That's touching, don't you think?",
        "Well, James... it looks like you're all alone.",
        "Not much more than a voyeur, are you?",
        "Too scared to join in.",
        "- I don't think you quite understand.",
        "- Oh, I think I do.",
        "You set cities on fire and watch innocent people burn, so you can convince governments to join an intelligence network you've paid for.",
        "Not that complicated.",
        "I'm guessing our little friend, C, he's one of your disciples.",
        "- You could say that.",
        "- And what does he get out of it?",
        "Nothing.",
        "He's a visionary, like me.",
        "Visionaries.",
        "Psychiatric wards are full of them.",

        "A nice pattern developed.",
        "You interfered in my world, I destroyed yours.",
        "Or did you think it was coincidence that all the women in your life ended up dead?",
        "Vesper Lynd, for example.",
        "She was the big one.",

        "You're a brave woman, my dear.",
        "Now I understand why my father lost his mind.",
        "He didn't lose his mind, he was just weak.",
        "But at least he understood what he was up against.",
        "You see, they failed to comprehend the crucial fact, that a terrible event can lead to something wonderful.",
        "Since you mention your father, I'll show you.",
        "She's clever.",
        "She's smarter than me.",

        "Your word?",
        "- The word of an assassin!",
        "- Turn this off.",
        "- This is important.",
        "- I said turn it off!",
        "I want you to understand something.",

        "It isn't taking place where he is.",
        "As you know all too well, dear Madeleine, a man lives inside his head.",
        "That's where the seat of his soul is.",
        "Now, James and I were both present recently when a man was deprived of his eyes.",
        "And the most astonishing thing happened.",
        "Didn't you notice?",
        "He wasn't there anymore.",
        "He'd gone even though he was still alive.",
        "So in this brief moment between life and death, there was nobody inside his skull.",
        "Most odd.",
        "So, James.",
        "I'm going to penetrate... to where you are.",
        "To the inside of your head.",
        "Now, the first probe will play with your sight, your hearing and your balance, just with the subtlest of manipulations.",
        "Well, get on with it then.",
        "Nothing can be as painful as listening to you talk.",
        "All right.",
        "Let's begin.",
        "Why are you doing this?",
        "You probably know that James here lost his parents when he was young.",
        "But did you know that it was my father who helped him through this difficult time?",
        "Over the course of two winters he taught him to ski, and climb, and hunt.",
        "He soothed the wounds of the poor little blue-eyed orphan.",
        "Asked me to treat him as a brother.",
        "My little brother.",
        "They formed quite an attachment.",

        "In a way, he's responsible for the path I took.",
        "So, thank you. Cuckoo.",
        "Do you know any other birdcalls, Franz?",
        "Hello, pussy.",
        "Franz Oberhauser died 20 years ago, James.",
        "In an avalanche, alongside his father.",

        "The recently deceased head of Spectre, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, and his chief of intelligence, your new best friend, C.",
        "About to take control of his very own global surveillance system that he built right here under our noses.",
        "Then we'd better move.",
        "The system goes online at midnight.",
        "If that happens, Spectre will have control of everything.",
        "So, you and I will have a quiet word with C while Q hacks into the system",
        "- and stops it going online.",
        "- It won't be easy.",
        "He'll find a way.",
        "He always does.",
        "It's good to have you back, 007.",
        "Sir.",

        "Are you in yet, Q?",
        "A few layers of impenetrable security still to go, but I think I'm getting somewhere.",
        "They've seen us!",
        "Go!",

        "Move.",

        "- No, but my Quartermaster is.",
        "- And he's extremely talented.",
        "- Well, bravo.",
        "But in case you hadn't realized it, you two are out of a job.",

        "Poor taste in friends.",
        "Take a look at the world.",
        "Chaos.",
        "Because people like you, paper-pushers and politicians, are too spineless to do what needs to be done.",
        "So I made an alliance to put the power where it should be.",
        "And now you want to throw it away for the sake of \"democracy.\"",

        "That's what I am afraid about.",
        "The two doses that we ordered for the patient are right here..",
        "..but we must order the third dose from Germany.",
        "But the problem is..",
        "..we can save her only if we start her treatment on time.",
        "Then start right away, aunty.",

        "..all powerful, modest, thinker, prudent.",
        "Is this one award, or a group of awards?",
        "It's like a horse race.",
        "That's why it's so long.",
        "So tell me, how do you feel on getting this award?",
        "I'll tell you.",

        "Did Tigress tell you?",
        "I heard from Monkey, and Crane, and Mantis... and your dad, and Mrs. Chow from the gift shop... and those ducks you just passed... and Tigress told me.",
        "Did she also tell you that it'll never happen again?",
        "Because I'm done.",

        "Of course I do.",
        "I'm the Dragon Warrior.",
        "And what exactly does that mean, Dragon Warrior?",

        "Defending the Valley!",
        "And stuff.",
        "Punching and kicking?",
        "You think that is what the great Master Oogway saw for you?",
        "A 500-year prophecy fulfilled so you could spend your days kicking butt... and running through town high-fiving bunnies?",

        "Incredible power awaits you.",
        "Power beyond anything you can imagine.",
        "Wow!",
        "What was that?",
        "That was chi.",
        "Wow!",
        "What's chi?",
        "The energy that flows through all living things.",
        "So you're saying if I teach, I'll be able to do cool stuff like that?",
        "No.",

        "Teaching?",
        "There's no way I'm ever gonna be like you.",

        "I'm trying to turn you into you.",
        "Turn me into me?",
        "Wait a second, that makes no...",
        "Almost there, Shifu.",
        "Just a little more confusing and you'll be the next Oogway.",
        "Sorry, no offense, Master Oogway.",

        "There will always be someone to stop you.",
        "Who?",
        "The panda?",
        "His chi is strong... but it won't be enough.",
        "He will meet the same fate as you.",
        "No.",
        "And so will every panda in that village.",
        "Yes.",
        "Po, I hope you're ready.",

        "Dance.",

        "It's all gone, Po.",
        "Everything.",
        "Everyone.",
        "Everyone?",
        "Everyone.",
        "How's my restaurant?",
        "We'll talk later.",
        "And now he's on his way here.",
        "He's after you, Po.",
        "He's after all pandas.",
        "How long do we have?",
        "Not long.",
        "Please, tell me you've mastered chi.",
        "-Here, take the baby.",
        "-Dad!",
        "Dad!",
        "Okay, who belongs to this one?",
        "You need to teach me the secret chi technique now!",
        "No, no, I'm afraid you need more time.",
        "Everyone, go get your things!",
        "Let me help you with that.",
        "I don't have more time.",
        "I need to learn it now!",
        "Sorry, you're not ready.",
        "Okay, pack everything!",
        "-I am ready.",
        "-Not quite.",
        "What are you talking about?",
        "I've done everything you've asked.",
        "I've mastered napping, sleeping in, hammocks, hot tubs.",
        "I am totally at one with my panda parts.",
        "Now why won't you show me?",
        "Because I don't know it!",
        "You what?",
        "I don't know it, okay?",
        "No one does.",
        "Maybe we used to.",
        "But not anymore.",
        "You lied?",
        "No, I...",
        "Yes.",
        "Why?",
        "To save your life!",
        "I find out some blade-swinging maniac is coming for you.",
        "What am I supposed to do?",
        "Just let that happen?",
        "Yes!",
        "I'm the Dragon Warrior.",
        "Facing maniacs, that's my job!",
        "But because of you, I left the Valley unprotected.",
        "I left my friends unprotected!",
        "And now they're all...",
        "They're all...",
        "And you would have been, too.",
        "I lost you once.",
        "I am not going to lose you again.",
        "I can't.",
        "You just did.",
        "Mom!",
        "Pick me!",
        "Po, I'm so worried for you... that I can't even enjoy being right about everything.",
        "Now run, run, run, as fast as those chubby legs can go!",
        "Run?",
        "There's nowhere to run.",
        "But what are you going to do?",
        "I'm gonna stay, and fight that monster.",
        "Po, he may be a monster, but he's still your father.",
        "Not him.",
        "Kai!",
        "No!",
        "Hungry?",
        "No, I...",
        "Not really.",
        "Well, maybe just one.",
        "You know, you weren't the only one who was lying.",
        "Oh?",
        "I didn't really come along because I was worried Po would go hungry.",
        "I was worried about you.",
        "Worried that I'd go hungry?",
        "No.",
        "I was worried you'd steal Po from me.",
        "I'd what?",
        "I know.",
        "That was crazy.",
        "But I realize having you in Po's life doesn't mean less for me.",
        "It means more for Po.",
        "Well, I'm not in his life.",
        "Not anymore.",
        "Your son got mad at you.",
        "Welcome to parenthood.",
        "You don't understand.",
        "I lied to him.",
        "He'll never forgive me.",
        "I lied to him for 20 years.",
        "He still thinks he came from an egg.",
        "Sometimes, we do the wrong things for the right reasons.",
        "Look.",
        "He's hurt.",
        "He's confused.",
        "And he still has to save the world.",
        "He needs both his dads.",
        "This isn't going to work.",
        "It has to.",
        "You're not thinking straight.",
        "-I am!",
        "-You're not.",
        "-I am!",
        "-No.",
        "-Yes, I am.",
        "-No.",
        "I've seen Kai.",
        "I've seen what he can do.",
        "But he hasn't seen what I can do.",
        "The Wuxi Finger Hold?",
        "It's my best move.",
        "I just have to get to Kai, grab his finger and then skadoosh!",
        "Back to the Spirit Realm.",
        "He has an army of jade warriors.",
        "Everything they see, he sees.",
        "So there's no sneaking up on him.",
        "You will never get close enough.",
        "It's gonna work!",
        "He can only be stopped by a master of chi.",
        "You sound just like Shifu with the, \"Chi, chi, chi.\"",
        "\"Chi this.",

        "You're right.",
        "There's no way I can stop him and his army.",

        "Not just me.",
        "Us.",
        "All of us.",
        "I finally found my son, after all these years.",
        "It's going to take a lot more than the end of the world... to keep us apart.",
        "But you don't even know kung fu.",
        "Then you will teach us.",
        "What?",
        "I can't teach you kung fu.",
        "I couldn't even teach Tigress.",
        "And she already knows kung fu!",
        "Po, I know I'm the last guy you wanna trust right now.",
        "But you gotta believe me.",
        "We can do this.",
        "We can learn kung fu.",
        "We can be just like you!",
        "What did you just say?",

        "- Basket.. why?",
        "Step him down!",
        "Here's an idea. Why don't we try good old fashioned stoning?",

        "Last night there was a blood moon, just as you described.",
        "Tell me what to reveal. And why should I trust you?",
        "You trusted me to hold your porch, remember?",
        "It was my stern. Clearly you need to spend more time at sea.",
        "Tell me what you found and I promise to help you.",
        "I don't need any help. Then why did come to me Carina?",
        "Why are we together in the middle of the sea..",
        "Chasing the same treasure?",
        "To release the power of the sea.",
        "- One must divide.",
        "- Divide? - What does it mean?",
        "- I'm not sure yet.",
        "Then we'll find out.",

        "If you could read it. Then it wouldn't be call the map that no man can read.",
        "I beg you please, don't argue with her.",
        "Most of the men on this ship can't read.",
        "Which makes all maps.",
        "Maps that no man can read.",
        "Well if you can't read it, then you've no use for it, or me.",
        "Let me start again.",

        "- What? No.",
        "- An astronomer contemplates the sky.",
        "- Yay, on a donkey. - No, there's no donkey!",
        "- Well then how do you breed then?",
        "Allows me to simplify this equation.",
        "Give me the map.",
        "Or I'll kill.. him, or kill him.",
        "Go on then.",
        "You're bluffing.",
        "And you're blushing.",
        "Throw him over.",
        "Young Henry will be tossed over.",
        "And he will be dragged under the ship.",
        "Alright. - What're you waiting for?",
        "- He doesn't appear to be.",
        "No.",
        "Not bluffing me.",
        "No, no, we don't have any food on board. Sorry.",
        "If he's lucky, he'll drown, before the barnacles shred him to ribbon.",
        "- Bernacles. - Like a thousands knives, across your back.",
        "And of course, the blood attracts sharks.",
        "Sharks? - Shark of the bow!",
        "- Where?",
        "I would say that swimming is no longer his primary concern.",
        "The map is there. - Where?",
        "- On the tip of your finger?",
        "In the heavens.",
        "That dairy will lead me to a map, hidden in the stars.",
        "Let him up, I'll find it tonight.",
        "Sorry, can't bring him up. Look for yourself.",
        "The sea has turned to blood, a sailor washed ashore.. Talking about the Trident.",
        "He was looking for Jack Sparrow.",
        "The same pirate who saved a witch from the gallows. - She's no Witch.",
        "- But you are.",
        "- And you're going to help us. - You afraid, Lieutenant?",
        "As ships burning the night, you want to know if you can save your own.",
        "- If the trident is real? - You are going to read that wall for me. Or you will die.",
        "The British Empire will have..",
        "The trident and rule the sea.",
        "I want to know where that pirate is going, with that witch.",
        "Your destiny is in these stars. I will set your course.",
        "No Spaghetti walls.",
        "Why did I bother coming to you?",
        "The dead are haunting us down and you do nothing. - Nothing, You call this nothing?",
        "- You're drunk and you're sleeping.",
        "My point exactly, I am doing two things at once.",
        "You can't save the unsavable mate.",
        "Like it or not Jack, you're going to help me. I will break my father's curse.",
        "Next time you raise a sword, boy.",
        "Be the last to die.",

        "Now, bit of discretion when goes into brunette. Never presume her sister.",
        "But if you can not avoid the charming sister.",
        "Kill the brother, savvy?",

        "- Has cost you five pieces.",
        "- I am not paying you for that.",
        "Never say that to a woman.",
        "Just because you can't see something does not mean it's not there.",
        "We have to find it.",
        "It's the only link to who I am. Who my father was.",
        "So we both spent our lives, searching for our fathers.",
        "Perhaps you and I are closer than you think.",
        "And so is up time.",
        "I'm not to disagree, but the precision of our accord, Ends at sunrise.",
        "This be will light, far from a fully rising sun.",
        "- And I know you to be a man of honor.",

        "- So we should...?",
        "- Leave her be. - She will take us to the Trident.",
        "- You've been saying that for hours. Two things we know are true, the stars don't shine by day.",

        "This chronometer keeps the exact time in London.",
        "I'm using it to make an altitude measurement..",
        "To determine longitude. Only then will we find our exact spot to see.",

        "No. - And the donkey?",
        "Salazar.",

        "So did I.",
        "Why would you go back there?",
        "Cersei's on her list of names.",
        "Who else is on your list?",
        "Most of them are dead already.",
        "Where did you get this?",
        "Littlefinger gave it to me.",
        "Littlefinger?",
        "He's here?",
        "He has declared for House Stark.",
        "Why would he give you a dagger?",
        "- He thought I'd want it.",
        "- Why?",
        "Because it was meant to kill me.",
        "The cutthroat...",
        "after your fall?",
        "Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?",
        "Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.",
        "He's not a generous man.",
        "He wouldn't give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back.",
        "- It doesn't matter.",
        "- What do you mean it doesn't matter?",
        "I don't want it.",
        "Are you sure?",
        "It's Valyrian steel.",
        "It's wasted on a cripple.",
        "Catelyn Stark would be proud.",
        "You kept your vow.",
        "I did next to nothing.",

        "What happened?",
        "Many things.",
        "Many things?",
        "Your Grace.",
        "I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits.",
        "Well, this is it.",
        "All we'll ever need.",
        "There is something else I want to show you, Your Grace.",
        "The children of the forest made these.",
        "When?",
        "A very long time ago.",
        "They were right here, standing where we're standing.",
        "Before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters.",
        "Maybe even before there were men.",
        "No.",
        "They were here together, the children and the First Men.",
        "Doing what?",
        "Fighting each other?",
        "They fought together against their common enemy.",
        "Despite their differences, despite their suspicions.",
        "Together.",
        "We need to do the same if we're going to survive.",
        "Because the enemy is real.",
        "It's always been real.",
        "And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?",
        "No, I don't think I can.",
        "I will fight for you.",
        "I will fight for the North.",
        "When you bend the knee.",
        "My people... won't accept a southern ruler.",
        "Not after everything they've suffered.",
        "They will if their king does.",
        "They chose you to lead them.",
        "They chose you to protect them.",
        "Isn't their survival more important than your pride?",
        "What is it?",
        "We took Casterly Rock.",
        "That's very good to hear.",
        "Isn't it?",
        "You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves.",

        "Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back.",
        "We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland.",
        "Commit to the blockade of King's Landing.",
        "- We have a plan.",
        "It's still the right plan.",
        "- The right plan!",
        "Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands, and the Reach.",
        "- If I have underestimated our enemies...",
        "- Our enemies?",
        "Your family, you mean.",
        "Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all.",
        "Enough with the clever plans.",
        "I have three large dragons.",
        "I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.",
        "We've discussed this.",
        "My enemies are in the Red Keep.",
        "What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?",
        "A smart one.",

        "- I would never presume to...",
        "- I'm at war.",
        "I'm losing.",
        "What do you think I should do?",
        "I never thought that dragons would exist again.",
        "No one did.",
        "The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen.",
        "Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen.",
        "Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known.",
        "But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different.",
        "You're just more of the same.",
        "Don't lunge.",

        "Nice sword.",
        "Very nice dagger.",
        "If they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores, then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with what they've brought.",
        "We can't...",
        "It's been a while since I trained.",
        "I can go and find the master of arms for you, my lady.",
        "He didn't beat the Hound.",
        "You did.",
        "I want to train with you.",
        "You swore to serve both my mother's daughters, didn't you?",
        "Move aside, Podrick.",
        "You can't use that, my lady.",
        "It's too small.",
        "I won't cut you.",

        "- Who?",
        "I believe you know of whom I speak.",

        "A good heart?",
        "I've noticed you staring at her good heart.",
        "There's no time for that.",
        "I saw the Night King, Davos.",
        "I looked into his eyes.",
        "How many men do we have in the North to fight him?",
        "10,000?",
        "Less?",
        "- Fewer.",
        "- What?",
        "Speaking of good hearts...",
        "Missandei of Naath.",
        "Ser Davos, Lord Snow.",
        "King Snow, isn't it?",
        "No, that doesn't sound right.",
        "- King Jon?",
        "- It doesn't matter.",
        "Forgive me, but may I ask a question?",
        "Of course.",
        "Your name is Jon Snow, but your father's name was Ned Stark?",
        "I'm a bastard.",
        "My mother and father weren't married.",
        "Is the custom different in Naath?",
        "We don't have marriage in Naath, so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.",
        "That sounds...",
        "liberating.",
        "Why did you leave your homeland?",
        "I was stolen away by slavers.",
        "I'm sorry.",
        "If I may, how did a slave girl come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?",
        "She bought me from my master and set me free.",
        "That was good of her.",
        "Of course, you're serving her now, aren't you?",
        "I serve my queen because I want to serve my queen.",
        "Because I believe in her.",
        "And if you wanted to sail home to Naath tomorrow?",
        "Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.",
        "You believe that?",
        "I know it.",
        "All of us who came with her from Essos, we believe in her.",
        "She's not our queen because she's the daughter of some king we never knew.",
        "She's the queen we chose.",
        "Will you forgive me if I switch sides?",
        "Is that a Greyjoy ship?",
        "Halt!",
        "Jon.",
        "I didn't know you were here.",
        "S-Sansa... is she all right?",
        "What you did for her... is the only reason I'm not killing you.",
        "We heard your uncle attacked your fleet.",
        "We thought you were dead.",
        "I should be.",
        "Your sister?",
        "Euron has her.",
        "I came to ask the queen to help me get her back.",
        "The queen is gone.",
        "Where did she go?",
        "Get the horses watered!",
        "All the gold's safely through the gates of King's Landing.",
        "Good.",
        "We need to get the last of these wagons over the Blackwater Rush before nightfall.",
        "The head of the line is ambushed, the tail will never be able to reinforce in time.",

        "With your permission, flogging stragglers has a marked effect on mobility.",
        "Let's give them fair warning first.",

        "Dickon.",
        "I hear you fought bravely at Highgarden.",
        "Your first battle?",
        "And?",
        "It was glorious.",
        "Come on, your father's not here.",
        "All my life, we've been pledged to House Tyrell.",
        "I knew some of those men.",

        "Hurry, she's killing him!",
        "Animam suam.",
        "I can feel him!",

        "It's okay.",
        "I'm still me.",
        "Flesh and blood, alive, for now.",

        "Stay here.",
        "Are you going somewhere, Kol?",
        "I asked for some time alone with her before you use me to do your dirty work.",

        "It's actually quite simple.",
        "I have long wanted to be mortal, but now that I am alive, I can die.",

        "When we first got here, there was always music outside, people dancing, laughing.",
        "But since she came back, it's so quiet.",
        "Like she's draining everything out of the city.",
        "She already took Uncle Elijah.",

        "Listen, Hope, I know you're scared.",

        "We need to find a way to resurrect him tonight, or we could lose him forever.",
        "To do that, we'll need more power.",
        "Let me guess, a grand sacrifice.",
        "I say we kill our enemy and sacrifice her, then I can channel the power from the Hollow's death, raise Elijah's body, and place him back where he belongs.",
        "- We've tried everything.",
        "- And we've come close.",
        "Labonair blood is her Achilles' heel.",
        "Hayley, your blood weakened her, but you've technically been dead for years.",
        "So it won't be strong enough to kill her.",
        "If we forge a blade using the blood of the last living Labonair...",
        "We don't want Hope involved.",
        "She's already involved.",
        "Hope has been obsessed with the symbol that follows the Hollow:",
        "the serpent consuming itself.",

        "The Hollow's one end of the Labonair bloodline.",
        "Hope is the other.",
        "And we need to close that loop.",
        "The best way to do that is for Hayley to wield a weapon forged with Hope's blood.",
        "When she stabs her, it's only then the Hollow can be obliterated completely.",
        "Then we make it work.",
        "I'll talk to Hope.",
        "Well, hey there.",
        "Uh, it's me again.",
        "Hope, uh, all is well where you are.",
        "You know, I really would love to talk to you about a few... hundred things.",
        "Like how Eddie uses this weird baby voice anytime he says \"hi\" to a random dog.",
        "I don't know, might be a deal breaker.",
        "Or how I finally watched Practical Magic.",
        "And you were right.",
        "Perfect movie.",

        "I miss her, too.",
        "Hey.",
        "Next time, we should carpool.",
        "Actually, I'm looking for Vincent.",
        "He said he'd find a cure for Sofya, but he's been M.I.A.",
        "Have you seen him?",
        "No.",
        "What, you want some help finding him?",
        "No.",
        "No, but if you see him, why don't you call me.",
        "Dauha naer do smrti.",
        "Dauha naer do smrti.",
        "Dauha naer do smrti.",
        "That's a rather odd locator spell.",
        "I'm trying to trace the Hollow's magic.",
        "Almost have it.",
        "She's in the Garden District.",
        "That's the LaForge House.",
        "At one time, it was the center of high society, but that all changed when",
        "Dr. LaForge tortured and killed his friends and family.",
        "Claimed until his dying day that an evil spirit made him do it.",
        "That house has been derelict since.",
        "The perfect lair for someone who relishes tragedy.",
        "What's that?",
        "If the serpent at the LaForge House represents the Hollow herself, then this must be some sort of totem she's using to magnify her power and protect herself.",
        "Dahlia used to use these when she was up to something particularly awful.",
        "It will render the Hollow unkillable.",
        "We will have to destroy it before we can face her.",
        "Lovely.",
        "I could do with some fresh air.",
        "And some fresh blood.",
        "Take the map.",
        "It's been spelled to track the totem.",
        "Don't go alone.",
        "One step ahead of you, sis.",
        "Hey, Bex.",
        "What's up?",
        "Someone's floating around with a trinket that's fueling our enemy's power.",
        "What say you help me track down and exterminate this scoundrel?",
        "I'd like nothing better.",
        "Perfect.",

        "Why not?",
        "As far as threats go, the only person with the means to kill me is lurking right out here.",
        "I'm not a threat to you, the Hollow, on the other hand, is.",
        "The Hollow's got some acolyte protecting a totem that magnifies her power, making her unkillable.",
        "Trouble is, we have to end this tonight.",
        "Hayley's got the means.",
        "I just need to make sure she's vulnerable.",
        "Kol's coming to watch my back, so you can just scamper off.",
        "What kind of gentlemen would I be if I didn't offer to escort you?",
        "You're the king of this city.",
        "Can't you condemn this dump?",
        "How about we skip the criticism and just focus on what we're looking for?",
        "Totem's not here.",
        "I scoured the house.",
        "There's no sign of it.",
        "You were supposed to wait for me.",
        "Well, I got bored.",
        "And it looks like you got accosted by the local riffraff.",
        "Oh, you got a problem?",
        "Get over yourselves.",
        "All right?",
        "The map says that the totem is still here, so it must be hidden somewhere in this hovel.",
        "Look, if you don't trust me, help yourself.",
        "Come on in.",
        "What...",
        "What the hell, Kol?",
        "A dark object?",
        "Really?",
        "Kol, you better undo this right now.",
        "I'm sorry, Rebekah.",
        "I truly am.",
        "Why are you helping her?",
        "What has she done to you?",
        "I don't want to.",
        "Are you scared it's gonna hurt?",
        "I'm scared if I do this, you're gonna pick a fight.",
        "And the Hollow, she can hurt you.",
        "I know you're scared.",
        "I wish we didn't have to have this conversation.",
        "When I was your age, I had to deal with a lot of things that I didn't want to deal with either.",
        "I didn't want that for you, but here we are.",
        "The thing is, sometimes you have to do things that you don't want to do because you're the only one that can do them.",
        "Like you.",
        "Like me.",
        "Okay.",
        "Rebekah's not answering.",
        "Neither is Kol.",
        "The sooner we end this the better.",
        "No. We have to assume that Inadu's totem is still intact.",
        "We cannot attack her until we destroy it.",
        "Go after Rebekah, find the totem.",
        "I'm not leaving Hayley alone.",
        "We're out of time.",
        "The cracks are getting worse.",
        "I need you to destroy the totem.",
        "I'll go with Hayley.",
        "And what about Hope?",
        "Compel her a nanny.",
        "We don't have another choice.",
        "You're the best advantage we got.",
        "Be fast, be brutal, destroy the totem, or we're dead.",
        "Here.",
        "For you and Hayley tonight.",
        "Anoint these with a drop of Hope's blood.",
        "They'll serve you well.",
        "You should destroy this.",
        "Hayley could die.",
        "And why is her life more important than yours?",
        "I can't take a little girl's mother away from her, Kol.",
        "All right, then we just have to find another way to get you out of this.",
        "Because there is no way I'm letting you go.",
        "I've been thinking,",
        "Elijah once gave me one of your mother's spells.",
        "It used to break a magical link.",
        "I'm too weak right now, but if we could find a coven to counter Inadu's spell, then...",
        "No, I know the spell.",
        "And we don't need a coven, we just need one powerful little witch.",
        "I have a car in the lot out back.",
        "If I'm not back by midnight, you take it and you go.",
        "Wait, without you?",
        "What...",
        "Are you kidding?",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Davina, I'm not asking.",
        "I need you to do this.",
        "Promise me.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I sealed these with Hope's blood.",
        "One for each of us.",
        "Once the totem is destroyed, we can sacrifice the Hollow.",
        "Are you okay?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I never thought twice about fighting or dying for family before.",
        "But now, with Keelin...",
        "Now you have someone you're afraid you're not gonna make it home to.",
        "You will make it home, Freya.",
        "I got your back.",
        "Hayley.",
        "I know we haven't always seen eye-to-eye, but... well, I suppose family rarely does.",
        "I guess she knows we're here.",
        "There you are.",
        "Jackson?",
        "Been waiting for you.",
        "How am I here?",
        "How are you here?",
        "I'm no expert, but I'm guessing you're going through some kind of psychological break right now.",
        "You've been through hell.",
        "So your mind took you somewhere peaceful,",
        "Honestly, I'm flattered you thought of me.",
        "Figured your happy place would be somewhere with Elijah.",
        "So... if I'm unconscious, then I need to wake up.",
        "I know.",
        "I know.",
        "I'm on your side.",
        "We'll get you back in the fight, before the Hollow finishes whatever she started.",
        "Hey, buddy.",
        "Are my mom and dad back?",
        "Not quite.",
        "Hey, you know what I used to do, when I was bored at your age?",
        "Magic.",
        "I'm not supposed to do magic with strangers.",
        "What?",
        "I-I'm family.",
        "So why did you go away?",
        "I went away because I was sad.",
        "And I thought I'd never be happy again.",
        "And I didn't want to make everybody that I loved around me sad, too.",
        "Hayley?",
        "Hayley?",
        "Hayley?",
        "No. More wolfsbane.",
        "I want her alive, but barely.",
        "She still has a part to play.",
        "No.",
        "No, no, no.",
        "You were supposed to be...",
        "This isn't real.",
        "No, you can't be dead.",
        "You aren't dead.",
        "Not yet.",
        "But I will be.",
        "No cell service to call your precious Sonya.",
        "Sofya.",
        "Apologies.",
        "I can't be expected to remember the names of wanton trollops.",
        "Listen, I'm gonna ask you nicely to shut the hell up about her.",
        "You know what?",
        "Why don't we just burn the house down?",
        "Oh, don't be so dramatic.",
        "Dramatic?",
        "I'm not running late for a manicure, Marcel.",
        "Time is running out to resurrect Elijah,",
        "Hayley's on a suicide mission, and I can't lose anyone else I love.",
        "I have reached my quota of heartbreak for the year.",
        "Rebekah...",
        "How ironic.",
        "Two of the world's most powerful beings trapped in a magical butterfly net.",
        "Tell me you weren't overwhelmed by some brain-dead witch.",
        "No, our biggest mistake was trusting Kol",
        "- for one second of his life.",
        "- What?",
        "Kol is protecting the totem for the Hollow.",
        "Who knows why, or what she offered him.",
        "I don't care what she offered him.",
        "Where is he?",
        "He's at the compound.",
        "Go.",
        "I need to snap out of this.",
        "If I don't, we could lose Elijah forever.",
        "Is he good to you?",
        "Hey, talk to me.",
        "It ain't gonna kill me.",
        "He has been good to me.",
        "But when I fell for him,",
        "I was scared of Klaus, of... being a mom, and he made me feel safe.",
        "But now, I...",
        "Well, if you wanted safety, you would've loved me.",
        "I chose you.",
        "I married you.",
        "But you were in love with him.",
        "I mean, it's an old, sad story.",
        "The monsters treated you like crap, turned you into a girl who loves monsters.",
        "You're not helping me.",
        "You're stalling me.",
        "No.",
        "Oh, you're not you.",
        "You're the Hollow.",
        "You're wasting your energy.",
        "You're a vision.",
        "You can't hurt me.",
        "You still don't get it, do you?",
        "The Hollow is more powerful than you can possibly imagine.",
        "Suppose your girlfriend won't be happy that you spent the entire day with me.",
        "Sofya hasn't woken since the Hollow invaded her mind.",
        "You could at least feign sympathy.",
        "Why?",
        "She shot me.",
        "Multiple times.",
        "Is that really the reason why you hate her so much?",
        "Okay.",
        "What the hell are you doing?",
        "The main gas line's got to be down here.",
        "At least it'll help torch the place faster, unless you prefer a slow burn.",
        "Thought you wanted to wait it out.",
        "Do you?",
        "If I untie this knot... your girlfriend will be free from the Hollow?",
        "I hope so.",
        "And you really love her?",
        "Yes.",
        "Kind of like your mom loves, uh...",
        "Uncle Elijah.",
        "You are miraculously well-adjusted.",
        "Why are you doing this?",
        "All I ever wanted was to protect you!",
        "And now you're gonna die here.",
        "No.",
        "Hayley!",
        "If you were stronger, then...",
        "You're not here.",
        "I'm always here.",
        "This is the vision of me that keeps you up at night, the fear of what you know to be inevitable.",
        "All right.",
        "Focus on the knot, luv.",
        "It's very important, and I'll be right back.",
        "I imagine right now you're rather cross with me.",
        "You should know I have my reasons.",
        "Rebekah suggested I hear them.",
        "I'd rather rip out your vocal chords.",
        "Hey, sorry, we're closed.",
        "Well, maybe you can make an exception.",
        "Davina?",
        "I don't know how long I have, but I had to see you to thank you.",
        "Wh-What do you mean?",
        "Thank me?",
        "For what?",
        "For visiting me.",
        "And for talking to me.",
        "You heard it?",
        "Y-You were there.",
        "Josh, I was always there.",
        "Now stop and listen.",
        "I did what I did for Davina.",
        "The Hollow brought her back, and now they're linked.",
        "I just need a bloody second to set her free.",
        "Lovesick imbecile.",
        "The Hollow preys upon your weakness.",
        "She raised Davina to get you to betray your family, and you, pathetic as you are, leapt at the chance.",
        "Our family owes Davina that much.",
        "I owe nothing to her.",
        "Nor to you.",
        "You saw it:",
        "the violence, the rage.",
        "That's what he is.",
        "You fell for the suit, Hayley.",
        "You were blinded by his charade.",
        "You're not Jackson, and you don't deserve to wear his face.",
        "You're right.",
        "Jackson was good.",
        "And me... well, I was never good.",
        "No, Nik, please.",
        "Hayley.",
        "Hey.",
        "Are you all right?",
        "Did Klaus break the totem?",
        "I hope so.",
        "But we can't wait.",
        "You need to stab the Hollow.",
        "You think you'll be strong enough?",
        "Let's do this.",
        "No, Nik.",
        "I need a little time.",
        "I just need to know she's alive.",
        "Please, grant me this small mercy.",
        "Mercy is a privilege reserved for family.",
        "Your status has been revoked.",
        "Brother, no!",
        "Please!",

        "Hey, what's wrong?",
        "Do it.",
        "No.",
        "No!",
        "That's enough!",
        "That's enough!",
        "She's gone.",
        "She's gone.",
        "Are you all right?",
        "You know how I love to blow things up.",
        "Good night.",
        "We were in love for two centuries, and now we're setting fires to avoid each other.",
        "All right, what the hell happened?",
        "I woke up from a dagger nap to find you trying to kill everyone that I love.",
        "Your brother ripped my heart out and then tossed my body off a bridge.",
        "And I didn't even see you crying.",
        "I mourned the man I thought I knew.",
        "Well, I'm sorry, I must have missed that while you were trying to curse me.",
        "I asked you to leave with me!",
        "Seven years ago, I asked you.",
        "But you didn't love me as much as you love New Orleans.",
        "All right, I do love New Orleans, all right, I do.",
        "And I watched it burn to the ground for you once before, Rebekah.",
        "And then I waited a century... and you didn't even come back for me.",
        "So you just forgot about me?",
        "You know, it's probably best if you just do that again.",
        "Yeah, you know what, I think it's best for both of us.",
        "Couldn't agree more.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Damn it.",
        "If Klaus got to him...",
        "Then you have to leave anyway.",
        "Davina, you almost died back there.",
        "Look, you remember the first day we met?",
        "You told me you wanted to be normal.",
        "You said \"normal's relative.\"",
        "Yeah, well, you're a twice-resurrected Harvest Girl with an Original vampire boyfriend.",
        "Normal's always gonna be relative.",
        "But with or without him, you have to take this chance.",
        "You deserve it.",
        "I can't just leave him.",
        "Well, that sounds like a broken promise.",
        "I thought that you were daggered, or worse.",
        "I caught Klaus in a rare charitable moment.",
        "But it won't last long.",
        "Are you ready to go?",
        "Anywhere.",
        "Anywhere?",
        "Everywhere.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I love you.",
        "I love you, too.",

        "She's not going to be here for when Elijah wakes?",
        "She said there was something she had to do.",
        "Oh, well, you know as well as anyone how the Hollow meddles in your mind, clawing at your oldest wounds, making them new again.",
        "Well, at least you have someone to comfort you now.",
        "Where is Keelin?",
        "I told her that we needed some family time tonight.",
        "We'll see her tomorrow.",
        "Freya, are you all right?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I just need to focus.",

        "As for Elijah,",
        "I know what he is.",

        "There's nothing to worry about anymore, okay?",
        "You didn't punish Kol.",
        "Well... he's family.",

        "Don't call me that.",
        "All right, calm down, Lavatory, it's only a nickname.",
        "No, a nickname is an affectionate term between mates.",
        "I think you're a massive prick, ergo not a nickname.",
        "Yeah, well, I'll show you a massive prick.",
        "This reprobate is Brian Fitzpatrick.",
        "In life, deeply unlikeable, smarmy and charmless.",
        "But give him something to sell, and somehow, he becomes transformed.",
        "Strong?",
        "President Reagan has a fallout shelter made entirely of our windows.",
        "Now, the science tells us these uPVC window frames will be around long after the human race is extinct.",
        "Also, the proud owner of a massive penis which he loves to unfurl at any given opportunity.",
        "And that's fine, is it?",
        "And this lovely man is Martin Lavender.",
        "Honest, decent and well educated.",
        "All qualities which, in our line of work, are about as much use as an aerated condom.",
        "Hello, I'm Martin Lavender from Cachet Windows.",
        "Just eating dinner.",
        "No, you have your dinner.",
        "I'll call back another day.",
        "Thanks, love.",
        "Formerly a musician, he quit his struggling band to join my sales team.",
        "\u266a Let me guess what's on your mind \u266a",

        "\u266a Wherever I lay my hat",
        "\u266a That's my home... \u266a",
        "Naturally, we rallied around to help him through this difficult period.",
        "Hey!",
        "Unlucky, mate, could've been you!",
        "Right, come on, look, I want to see some orders.",
        "Don't be shy, Lavender.",
        "Yeah, his mother wasn't.",
        "- Four.",
        "- Bollocks!",
        "4,000.",
        "That's got to be a personal best for you, innit?",
        "Could've been seven if this snake hadn't undercut me on Warren Close.",
        "You're having a laugh.",
        "There's nothing wrong with my prices, it's just you.",
        "You couldn't sell ice to a bloody Eskimo.",
        "But Eskimos don't need ice.",
        "Why would I sell it to them?",
        "Well, you know, cos of the saying,",
        "\"He could sell ice to the Eskimos.\"",
        "You're the fucking opposite, ain't ya?",
        "Yeah, that's not how opposites work.",
        "I get a lot of this.",
        "All right, then, you couldn't sell food to a starving Ethiopian with flies round his eyes and pot belly... shit up his legs.",
        "I'd just give him some food.",
        "I'm not a monster.",
        "Which is why I will always outsell you in any sales environment.",
        "So you reckon you could sell ice to the Eskimos?",
        "Not only sell it to them.",
        "By the time I'd left their little igloo, they'd be asking me to be godfather to their adorable slanty-eyed kids.",
        "Tell me, is it only lazy cultural stereotypes you sell to, or real people, too?",
        "Well, unlike Professor No Nuts over there,",
        "I could sell anything to anyone.",
        "So, taking the ice and Eskimos analogy, you reckon you could sell new windows to someone you've recently sold new windows to?",
        "Yes.",
        "I've got a ton says you can't.",
        "You had a ton.",
        "You might as well hand over those notes now, Lavatory.",
        "Right, if you bucks are done rutting, I want to see some orders.",
        "Brian?",
        "13 five.",
        "Impressive.",
        "Who'd have thought a weaselly fucker with terrible BO like you could charm the life savings out of anyone?",
        "Well, here's mine.",
        "Just the 17K.",
        "Which makes me employee of the fucking century.",
        "But don't feel too bad about it, boys, it's still a record week.",
        "And to celebrate, I've lined up a special treat for us all on Saturday night.",
        "Now, let's get out there.",
        "These windows aren't going to sell them-fucking-selves.",
        "- Morning, Vincent.",
        "- Morning, Carol.",
        "Can you dig out the address for the Solomon house?",
        "I've got time to pop by later...",
        "Guess who...?",
        "The last time I saw these beautiful fingers, they were wrapped around my...",
        "- ..has got the kids with them.",
        "- ..my neck.",
        "They were wrapped around my neck.",
        "My fault for farting in bed, eh, Sam?",
        "That's not what you were going to say.",
        "- What was he going to say?",
        "- Nothing. Go and play outside.",
        "Go on, I want a word with your dad.",
        "Hello, baby.",
        "Oh, I know.",
        "Incredible, isn't she?",
        "What's up?",
        "I thought Cachet's number one salesman might like some lunch.",
        "It's only cheese, but I swiped a Penguin from Robbie's school dinner tin as a little treat.",
        "I do not deserve an angel like you in my life.",
        "I know.",
        "So what time you home tonight?",
        "I'm doing a curry.",
        "Can't do tonight. I've got house calls to make.",
        "You are joking?",
        "This is the third night this week.",
        "Sam, honey.",
        "The best time to close a deal is when the husband and wife are both there.",
        "Evenings, weekends, these are the golden hours.",
        "And when do you plan fitting us into your hectic schedule, then?",
        "Christmas?",
        "Bank holidays?",
        "I'm trying to build something for us here.",
        "In a few months, I'll ease off, but not right now.",
        "I'll make it up to you, gorgeous.",
        "I promise.",
        "_",
        "You realise there is no part of this I cannot see?",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Don't worry.",
        "I'm obviously not wanted here.",
        "Sam. Come back.",
        "Sam, come back...",
        "Ignore her, she's mental!",
        "\"Thanks for rescuing me, Carol,\" might be nice.",
        "Meanwhile, it hadn't taken Fitzpatrick long to find a 73-year-old Eskimo to sell ice to.",
        "But you only put these windows in three weeks ago.",
        "I know, Mrs Brown.",
        "I'm embarrassed to be here.",
        "But it's only just come to light that there is a major design flaw in the plastic frames of those windows that no-one could have foreseen.",
        "- The white bits?",
        "- Yeah, the white bits.",
        "See, they're made from a plastic compound called unplasticised polyvinyl chloride, or uPVC for short.",
        "We've only just discovered that when exposed to sunlight, that type of plastic might explode.",
        "- Oh, no.",
        "- Oh, no, indeed.",
        "But it's not all bad news.",
        "Have you heard of Nasa?",
        "The space people?",
        "They're the ones.",
        "Now, as part of the space shuttle programme, they've developed a far superior plastic compound, one that won't kill you.",
        "Does it have a name?",
        "Yep, it's called... PVCu.",
        "So, what I would like to do is exchange these dangerous uPVC windows for nice, new, safe PVCu ones, free of charge, apart from installation costs.",
        "Oh, I don't know.",
        "I should probably ask my son about that.",
        "Is your son Neil Armstrong?",
        "No.",
        "Then I don't think he's qualified to help us.",
        "- Read it and weep.",
        "The whole house?",
        "How have you done that?",
        "You know. Sales acumen, charm.",
        "Oh, no, wait.",
        "You don't know, do you?",
        "Now, come on, you owe me a ton.",
        "Yeah, hold on, you've only charged her 100 quid for fitting.",
        "Have you given her a house full of free windows just to win a bet?",
        "Lavatory. The word \"free\" is not in my vocabulary.",
        "Just like the phrase \"I've had a number one hit\" is not in yours.",
        "No, I've got a fitter coming tomorrow to rip out those windows and pop the very same ones straight back in again.",
        "The old bag'll never know.",
        "So not only have I sold ice to the Eskimos,",
        "I've sold them their own fucking ice.",
        "I'm a genius!",
        "Come on, pay up.",
        "Oh, yes, there we go.",
        "Oh, nom, nom, nom!",
        "Unlike Fitzpatrick, I don't need to use the dark arts to close a deal.",
        "Good morning, Mr Solomon.",
        "Vincent from Cachet Windows, we spoke on the phone earlier.",
        "Ah, Mr Vincent, yes.",
        "Look, I'm so sorry, but we're about to sit down for prayer.",
        "Maybe you can leave some brochures and we can phone you about prices tomorrow?",
        "Want to know the percentage of people who sleep on it and call you back?",
        "A big fat fucking zero.",
        "This may sound odd, but may I join?",
        "It's been a spiritually exhausting last few days for me.",
        "We'd be delighted.",
        "Come in. One more thing, salesmen are like vampires.",
        "Never invite one into your home.",
        "Once you do, we won't leave your side until we taste blood.",
        "Not even for a piss.",
        "- Thank you!",
        "- No problem!",
        "The peace of God...",
        "Using the homeowner's loo is a cardinal sin, no matter how desperate you are.",
        "The second you leave those poor bastards alone, they'll try to conspire a way to get you out of their house.",
        "You need to get the kids to bed?",
        "That's OK.",
        "I'll give you a hand with bath time.",
        "Your husband is having a heart attack?",
        "Let me run you both down to AE, you lying shitbags.",
        "These God-fearing fuckers have been praying for almost two hours.",
        "And it's not just world peace shit, either.",
        "Lord, please use thy divine power to find a good cash buyer for Brian and Kellie's car.",
        "Dear merciful Lord, please do what you can to get a better reception for Aggy's TV.",
        "Dear Lord, please give me the strength not to piss my pants in front of these time-wasting sons of bitches.",
        "Eventually, my bladder's prayers were answered and Mr Solomon signed for a full house of windows.",
        "It's safe to say I eat, sleep, breathe, shit and piss... ..sales.",
        "But like Einstein, my true genius wasn't spotted until later in life.",
        "_",
        "So, after spending a couple of grand having this fucking mutt's back legs amputated and wheels put on it, he takes it out for its first walk, and the fucking dog panics, and rolls straight under a bus.",
        "Poor bastard is devastated.",
        "I told him, \"Look on the bright side.",
        "\"At least now, you've got a \u00a32,000 rug.\"",
        "Yeah, this is him.",
        "Fuck.",
        "Now, that was a call informing me that while I'd been otherwise engaged, a supertanker on the Thames estuary had been accidently loaded with contaminated crude oil.",
        "Unfortunately, the constant monitoring required to prevent such million-pound fuck-ups was my one and only job.",
        "Upon careful reflection, you are to be relieved of all duties with immediate effect.",
        "Do you have anything to say for the record, Mr Swan?",
        "This is fucking ridiculous...",
        "Maybe we should take a break.",
        "Listen, I've spoken to the boys.",
        "They're ready to walk out for you on this one, Vince.",
        "I appreciate the support of the union on this, Terry.",
        "But I'm jacking it in.",
        "I fucking hate this job anyway.",
        "How else are you going to provide for Sam and the kids? Hm?",
        "I'll figure something out.",
        "Oi, you two, the charisma twins.",
        "Upon careful reflection,",
        "I've decided you can stick your job up your arses.",
        "Here's my notice of resignation.",
        "I couldn't face going home to tell Sam I'd lost my job.",
        "I said I'd figure something out, and that's what I intended to do... right after I got absolutely rat-arsed.",
        "I never was a whisky drinker.",
        "Fuck me.",
        "Vincent Swan.",
        "Dicky Cox?",
        "Dicky Dipshit, I think you used to call me at school.",
        "Cox by name, cock by nature.",
        "Yeah, that was another one.",
        "You all right, Vince?",
        "You look like shit.",
        "No. No, I'm not all right, Dicky.",
        "I got sacked this morning, and now I'm crying next to a urinal full of my own puke, talking to you.",
        "No offence, but I think I just hit rock-bottom.",
        "I mean, it's funny how life turns out, innit?",
        "Who'd have put money on me being the bloody successful one and you, Vincent Swan, being such a fucking loser?",
        "Cheers for the pep talk, Coxy Yeah.",
        "Vincent, what would you say if I told you I earned four times as much as your monthly wage in the last week?",
        "I'd say, \"Unless the demand for creepy-looking gigolos",
        "\"has gone through the roof, that's bollocks.\"",
        "Yeah, funny.",
        "Here.",
        "Have a chuckle at that.",
        "_ Plus, I've got something else that could interest you.",

        "I'm not talking about the drugs.",
        "What, a lump of fucking plastic?",
        "Is it?",
        "Or is it white gold?",
        "No, it's definitely a lump of plastic.",
        "To the uninitiated.",
        "But you add some know-how and some bullshit, and this lump of fucking plastic turns into something far more eye-catching.",
        "Coxy laid out the double-glazing business for me.",
        "Since Thatcher handed us the right to buy your council house, the world and his wife were madly renovating their newly owned dream homes.",
        "White gold was just plastic, a cheap alternative to timber, but it brought the cost of making brand-new windows down to peanuts.",
        "Coxy would then sell them on with a 600% mark-up.",
        "For those that couldn't afford the astronomical prices, he'd sell them finance.",
        "That way, they could pay back what they thought they could afford each month... for the rest of their natural lives.",
        "Eventually, those shiny new windows would cost more than their dreary former council houses.",
        "It was beautiful.",
        "I want this.",
        "You can have it.",
        "No, not this!",
        "I mean, meeting you.",
        "Losing my job.",
        "Everything.",
        "It's happened for a reason.",
        "You ain't going to cry again, are you?",
        "You always were a fucking dipshit.",
        "My fate was sealed the very next day.",
        "I'm not a big believer in kismet, but you'd have to be blind, deaf and dumb as shit not to hear destiny calling me.",
        "Sorry to interrupt.",
        "Oh, it's an elephant.",
        "It's not male genitalia.",
        "I'm looking for the owner.",
        "Oh, sorry, I'm new here.",
        "Right.",
        "Is the owner around?",
        "Like I said, I'm new, so I literally can't help you.",
        "Fuck me, Carol.",
        "You're a receptionist.",

        "Well, it doesn't hurt to be careful, Tony.",

        "Hello, sir. I take it this is your business?",
        "You've got two minutes, pal.",
        "For what?",
        "To sell me whatever the fuck it is you're selling, then fuck off.",

        "I've already got a sales team.",
        "Well, that was succinct.",
        "Now we've got 90 seconds to fill with small talk.",
        "Or you could just fuck off early.",
        "Right. And where's the fun in that?",
        "You see that couple?",
        "They walked into your showroom four minutes ago.",
        "In another 45 seconds, they're going to walk out, along with thousands in lost revenue."
